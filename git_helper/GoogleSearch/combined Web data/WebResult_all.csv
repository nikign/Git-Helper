I\'ve even tried purging GIT completely from the system (and deleting ~/.gitconfig) then reinstalling it.\nIf I delete the [push] section completely from the .gitconfig file (or if I delete the file entirely), then try to push, then I get this:\nGit 2.0 from \'matching\' to \'simple\'. To squelch this message\nand maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:\n\n  git config --global push.default matching\n\nTo squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:\n\n  git config --global push.default simple\n\nSee \'git help config\' and search for \'push.default\' for further information.\n(the \'simple\' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode\n\'current\' instead of \'simple\' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)\n\nerror: Malformed value for push.default: simple\nerror: Must be one of nothing, matching, tracking or current.\nfatal: bad config file line 8 in /home/leng/.gitconfig\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\n\n...so it appears to be both acknowledging that I haven\'t chosen a pushing behavior, but then also saying that I\'ve chosen an unsupported behavior.  What on earth is going on here?\nI even get the error if I delete ~/.gitconfig completely.\nCan anyone help me out with this witchcraft?\nThanks!\nEDIT:\nHere is a .git/config file requested:\n[core]\n        repositoryformatversion = 0\n        filemode = true\n        bare = false\n        logallrefupdates = true\n[remote ""origin""]\n        url = ssh://{my remote repo}\n        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*\n[branch ""master""]\n        remote = origin\n        merge = refs/heads/master', 'link': u'http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21083747/git-cant-push-strange-config-issue', 'title': u""GIT: Can't Push (Strange Config Issue)""}"

"{'abstract': u'I have tried googling and read through http://help.github.com/troubleshooting-ssh/ and various, various guides.

I\'ve successfully been able to create repos and push -u origin master fine on my laptop but on this desktop I\'m having issues.\nHere\'s what I tried:\n1. I have setup my git user name\n2. I have setup my git user email\n3. I have uploaded the contents of my /home/meder/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to github\'s account page. I have verified I did not paste any whitespace\n4. I have created a ~/.ssh/config with these contents:\n  Host github.com\n  User git\n  Hostname github.com\n  PreferredAuthentications publickey\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nI have chmodded the .ssh to 700, id_rsa 600\n5. I have added the proper remote origin without making typos : git remote add origin git@github.com:medero/cho.git\n6. To confirm #5, here is my .git/config. The directory is correct and not another directory:\n[remote ""origin""]\n        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*\n        url = git@github.com:medero/cho.git\n\n7. ssh git@github.com -v gives me a successful Authentication\n8. One weird thing is, the username which it greets me with has t appended to it. My github username is medero, not medert.\n\nHi mederot! You\'ve successfully\n  authenticated, but GitHub does not\n  provide shell access.\n\n9. I am not behind a proxy or firewall\n10. The key is offered, heres the output from -v:\n\ndebug1: Host \'github.com\' is known and matches the RSA host key.\ndebug1: Found key in /home/meder/.ssh/known_hosts:58\ndebug1: ssh_rsa_verify: signature correct\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent\ndebug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sent\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey\ndebug1: Next authentication method: publickey\ndebug1: Offering public key: /home/meder/.ssh/id_rsa\ndebug1: Remote: Forced command: gerve mederot\ndebug1: Remote: Port forwarding disabled.\ndebug1: Remote: X11 forwarding disabled.\ndebug1: Remote: Agent forwarding disabled.\ndebug1: Remote: Pty allocation disabled.\ndebug1: Server accepts key: { some stuff, dont know if i should share it\n\ndebug1: Remote: Forced command: gerve mederot\ndebug1: Remote: Port forwarding disabled.\ndebug1: Remote: X11 forwarding disabled.\ndebug1: Remote: Agent forwarding disabled.\ndebug1: Remote: Pty allocation disabled.\ndebug1: Authentication succeeded (publickey).\n\n\n11.

"{'abstract': u""The story:\nI've been developing a RoR-app in both my desktop and laptop. It was quite handy to commit changes made on another, push them to github and fetch & merge on other.\nThe starting point is this: I committed latest changes on my desktop, pushed them to github and then fetched and merged them into my laptop. Then, I made some commits on laptop and pushed to github. Took the changes, merged to my desktop (with --no-ff). THEN, happened the probable source of all mischiefs: I reverted the desktop to commit where it was before the latest fetch & merge. Made some development work with it, committed, pushed to github. In the laptop, I did the revert as well, though I reverted it to a commit which was made somewhere between the latest fetch from github, fetched again and merged those. Some error messages came after reverting desktop and laptop both, but things worked still fairly well and I kept working on both machines.\nUntil now. I tried to push from my laptop to github, which gives the following output:        \n Counting objects: 106, done.\n error: unable to find 5a2a4ac...\n error: unable to find bc36923...\n error: unable to find ecb0d86... \n error: unable to find f76d194...\n error: unable to find f899df7...\n Compressing objects: 100% (64/64), done.\n fatal: failed to read object 5a2a4ac... : Invalid argument\n error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github:username/repo.git'\n\nSo, the question is, what exactly took place here?\nEDIT: It seems that because of suspending my laptop and moving it from place to place in that state screwed up the hard drive somehow.

Part of the deploy script use pushes the subtree out to project B\'s repo:\ngit subtree push -P sub/path/name --squash git@github.com:MyCo/project_b.git projectb_branch\nit starts pushing the commits and fails with \n""fatal: bad object {sha}"" \n\nI\'ve searched for the SHA in the source repo\'s git log. It shows up in a commit:\ngit-subtree-dir: app/assets/ui\ngit-subtree-split: {sha}\n\nThe target repo (project_b) does indeed have a commit with that SHA but the source repo does not. I walked through the subtree shell script I can see that it\'s failing when it tries to look up that object with git log (in the toptree_for_commit function calling git log -l --pretty=format:\'%T\' {sha}).\nAt this point I am in way over my head but eager to try to find a solution.

"{'abstract': u'First of all, Git sucks.  I know, I know, it\'s supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread, but it sucks.  It\'s like trying to shave with a chainsaw: one slight mistake and there are blood and teeth everywhere.  Perhaps, if I could actually make an exact distinction between a head, a ref, a commit, a branch, a stem, a gnargel, and a whizpoo, some of this might be a little easier but to an ordinary mortal with only 10 years experience of SVN, Perforce, and RCS, it all looks like rather cranky black magic.\nNow for some reason, git pull has never worked for me.

I wanted to get the latest changes from the remote repository to the local one, but I mistyped.  Instead of writing git pull origin master, I wrote git pull origin lounge and then, without thinking, typed in the correct command.  \nThere\'s no evidence of the first (bad) pull in log, just two merges from the master:\ncommit 0c6be9569bab0581244ea8603bf2edfee82cdd7b\nMerge: 43fdec5... db09f0d...\nAuthor: Malvolio <info@xcompanyx.com>\nDate:   Wed Nov 24 20:38:58 2010 -0500\n\nMerge branch \'master\' of github.com:xcompanyx/xRepositoryX\n\ncommit db09f0d79d744d6a354142041b47ff5d748999f3\nMerge: 81b6c3d... fc73e25...\nAuthor: Malvolio <info@xcompanyx.com>\nDate:   Wed Nov 24 17:38:16 2010 -0800\n\nMerge branch \'master\' of github.com:xcompanyx/xRepositoryX\n\ncommit 81b6c3d04b7c464f8750a56282635526a5ef83a1\nAuthor: Michael <info@xcompanyx.com>\nDate:   Wed Nov 24 17:38:07 2010 -0800\n    the last commit I did\n\nBut files newly created in the lounge branch are there in my repository.\nSo now I\'m fscked, right?

"{'abstract': u'I tried to open my repository today and it came up with no commit history. Everything I tried (git status, git log, git checkout...) threw an error about a corrupt object.\nI researched this problem online and found the article by Linus Torvalds, but got lost at the point where he found the broken link ID: none of my file IDs, tree or blob, match the culprit ID thrown by the error message.\nI then returned to the article on recovering ""git objects damaged by hard disk failure"" and (after moving the culprit object out of the way) worked my way through until \n$ cat packed-refs\n\nat which point my computer said: cat: packed-refs: No such file or directory\nI skipped that step and did the\n$ git fsck --full\n\nand got the appropriate output, but then I was supposed to copy the culprit (or what I was referring to as the culprit, the sha1 ID thrown by the error) from a backup repository back into the main repository, then copy the missing objects from the backup repository into the main repository, as far as I can tell; and I don\'t want to do anything too drastic or I might force something I can\'t unforce later.\nSo my question(s) is (are), was I supposed to have made a backup (ooh, newbie alert), or was that what happened when I unpacked the .pack file?

"{'abstract': u'Last week, I made a number of changes to my local branch before leaving town for the weekend. This morning I wanted to dcommit all of those changes to the company\'s Svn repository, but I get a merge conflict in one file:\n\nMerge conflict during commit: Your file or directory \'build.properties.sample\' is probably out-of-date: The version resource does not correspond to the resource within the transaction.  Either the requested version resource is out of date (needs to be updated), or the requested version resource is newer than the transaction root (restart the commit).\n\nI\'m not sure exactly why I\'m getting this, but before attempting to dcommit, I did a git svn rebase.  That ""overwrote"" my commits. To recover from that, I did a git reset --hard HEAD@{1}. Now my working copy seems to be where I expect it to be, but I have no idea how to get past the merge conflict; there\'s not actually any conflict to resolve that I can find.\nAny thoughts would be appreciated.\nEDIT: Just wanted to specify that I am working locally. I have a local branch for the trunk that references svn/trunk (the remote branch). All of my work was done on the local trunk:\n$ git branch\n  maint-1.0.x\n  master\n  * trunk\n$ git branch -r\n  svn/maintenance/my-project-1.0.0\n  svn/trunk\n\nSimilarly, git log currently shows 10 commits on my local trunk since the last commit with a Svn ID.\nHopefully that answers a few questions.\nThanks again.', 'link': u'http://stackoverflow.com/questions/629048/git-svn-dcommit-error-restart-the-commit', 'title': u'Git Svn dcommit error - restart the commit'}"

There are many svn copy operations (Subversion people call them branches) in the history of my Subversion repository. The release policy has been that after each release or other branches created, the old URL is left unused and the new URL replaces the old one for containing the work.\nOptimally, by my reading, it seems like this should do the trick:\n$ git svn clone --username=mysvnusername --authors-file=authors.txt \\\n    --follow-parent \\\n    http://svnserver/svn/src/branches/x/y/apps/module module\n\n(where branches/x/y/ depicts the newest branch).

With newer Subversion, if there is no read access to some super directory of the URL path (true for me, svn ls http://svnserver/svn fails with 403 Forbidden), then we fail with some Subversion operations.\nJeff Fairley in his answer points out that spaces in the Subversion URL might also cause this error message (confirmed by user Owen). Have a look at his solution to see how he solved the case if your git svn clone is failing for the same resson.\nDejay Clayton in his answer reveals that if the deepest subdirectory components in branch and tag svn urls are equally named (e.g. .../tags/release/1.0.0 and .../branches/release-candidates/1.0.0) then this error could occur."", 'link': u'http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12161541/work-around-for-failing-git-svn-clone-requiring-full-history', 'title': u'Work-around for failing \u201cgit svn clone\u201d (requiring full history)'}"

"{'abstract': u'I don\'t want a visual merge tool, and I also don\'t want to have to vi the conflicted file and manually choose the between HEAD (mine) and the imported change (theirs).  Most of the time I either want all of their changes or all of mine.  Commonly this is because my change made it upsteam and is coming back to me through a pull, but may be slightly modified in various places.\nIs there a command line tool which will get rid of the conflict markers and choose all one way or another based on my choice?  Or a set of git commands which I can alias myself to do each one.\n# accept mine\nalias am=""some_sequence;of;commands""\nalias at=""some_other_sequence;of;commands""\n\nDoing this is rather annoying.\nFor \'accept mine\' I have tried: \nrandy@sabotage ~/linus $ git merge test-branch\nAuto-merging Makefile\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in Makefile\nAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n\nrandy@sabotage ~/linus $ git checkout Makefile \nerror: path \'Makefile\' is unmerged\n\nandy@sabotage ~/linus $ git reset --hard HEAD Makefile \nfatal: Cannot do hard reset with paths.\n\nHow am I supposed to get rid of these change markers?\nI can do: \ngit reset HEAD Makefile; rm Makefile; git checkout Makefile\n\nBut this seems rather round about, there must be a better way.  And at this point, I\'m not sure if git even thinks the merge happened, so I don\'t think this necessarily even works.\nGoing the other way, doing \'accept theirs\' is equally messy.\nThe only way I can figure it out is do:\ngit show test-branch:Makefile > Makefile; git add Makefile;\n\nThis also gives me a messed up commit message, which has Conflicts: Makefile in it twice.\nCan someone please point out how to do the above two actions in a simpler way?

First, the \'fatal: pathspec\' message from git rm is both unhelpful and misleading (in this vanilla user\'s opinion). Second, I had the file in .gitignore, but had removed it before asking my question. However, it was also included in IDEA\'s Ignored Files feature independently of git, and showed as such in the project viewer (instead of untracked, as git status showed). Finally, I had IDEA running while I was experimenting, and it looks like it was recreating the file immediately after my rm. So, my takeaway is that if I\'m getting confusing Git behavior, make sure to quit IDEA and work soley in the command line (and gitk) while debugging. And that SO users are awesome.

But it's not working.\nBasically, my workflow is like this:\n\nCheckout stable version to a new branch to experiment with new code \nMake a bunch of changes - I have no intent on keeping any of this, I'm just experimenting.\nLook at all the stuff I changed\nAdd all the changes to be tracked\nCommit the branch and push branch to origin (if it worked, otherwise skip this step)\nDecide to try another method, go back to master\nObserve artifacts from the experimental branch I was working in, even though I'm in the master branch.\n\nEvery time I checkout a branch to another branch, make changes to the one branch, and then checkout the original branch, I still have all the files and changes that happened in the other branch.  This is getting extremely frustrating.  I've read that this can happen when you have files open in the IDE while doing this, but I've been pretty careful about that and both closed the files in the IDE, closed the IDE, and shut down my rails server before switching branches, and this still happens.  Also, running 'git clean -f' either deletes everything that happened after some arbitrary commit (and randomly, at that), or, as in the latest case, didn't change anything back to its original state.  \nI thought I was using git correctly, but at this point, I'm at my wit's end here.  I'm trying to work with a bunch of experimental code using a stable version of my project, but I keep having to manually track down and fix all the changes I made.  Any ideas or suggestions?\ngit checkout -b photo_tagging\ngit branch # to make sure it's right\n# make a bunch of changes, creations, etc\ngit status # see what's changed since before\ngit add . # approve of the changes, I guess, since if I do git commit after this, it says no changes\ngit commit -m 'these are changes I made'\n\ngit checkout master\ngit branch #=> *master\n\n# look at files, tags_controller is still there, added in photo_tagging\n# and code added in photo_tagging branch are still there in *master\n\nThis seems to happen whether I do a commit or not on the branch."", 'link': u'http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4515644/git-checkout-does-not-change-anything', 'title': u'Git checkout does not change anything'}"

"{'abstract': u""I am using Git alone for my local software project in Visual Studio 2010. Recently I created a new branch to do a larger refactoring of one of the dialogue windows. I did the following modifications:\n\nRename Form1 to Form1a (including all depending files)\nAdd new Form1\n\nI checked this change into the branch, say form-refactoring. Interestingly, Git didn't notice that I renamed the file Form1.cs into Form1a.cs and created a brand new, totally different Form1.cs, but instead it noticed a new Form1a.cs file and found a whole lot of differences between the previous and new Form1.cs files. This will of course lead to totally garbaged diffs, but I don't care in this case as long as all files are handled correctly in the end.\nThen I switched back to master to do some other small changes.

"{'abstract': u'We have a Git repository with over 400 commits, the first couple dozen of which were a lot of trial-and-error. We want to clean up these commits by squashing many down into a single commit. Naturally, git-rebase seems the way to go. My problem is that it ends up with merge conflicts, and these conflicts are not easy to resolve. I don\'t understand why there should be any conflicts at all, since I\'m just squashing commits (not deleting or rearranging). Very likely, this demonstrates that I\'m not completely understanding how git-rebase does its squashes.\nHere\'s a modified version of the scripts I\'m using:\n\nrepo_squash.sh (this is the script that is actually run):\n\nrm -rf repo_squash\ngit clone repo repo_squash\ncd repo_squash/\nGIT_EDITOR=../repo_squash_helper.sh git rebase --strategy theirs -i bd6a09a484b8230d0810e6689cf08a24f26f287a\n\n\nrepo_squash_helper.sh (this script is used only by repo_squash.sh):\n\nif grep -q ""pick "" $1\nthen\n#  cp $1 ../repo_squash_history.txt\n#  emacs -nw $1\n  sed -f ../repo_squash_list.txt < $1 > $1.tmp\n  mv $1.tmp $1\nelse\n  if grep -q ""initial import"" $1\n  then\n    cp ../repo_squash_new_message1.txt $1\n  elif grep -q ""fixing bad import"" $1\n  then\n    cp ../repo_squash_new_message2.txt $1\n  else\n    emacs -nw $1\n  fi\nfi\n\n\nrepo_squash_list.txt: (this file is used only by repo_squash_helper.sh)\n\n# Initial import\ns/pick \\(251a190\\)/squash \\1/g\n# Leaving ""Needed subdir"" for now\n# Fixing bad import\ns/pick \\(46c41d1\\)/squash \\1/g\ns/pick \\(5d7agf2\\)/squash \\1/g\ns/pick \\(3da63ed\\)/squash \\1/g\n\n\nI\'ll leave the ""new message"" contents to your imagination. Initially, I did this without the ""--strategy theirs"" option (i.e., using the default strategy, which if I understand the documentation correctly is recursive, but I\'m not sure which recursive strategy is used), and it also didn\'t work. Also, I should point out that, using the commented out code in repo_squash_helper.sh, I saved off the original file that the sed script works on and ran the sed script against it to make sure it was doing what I wanted it to do (it was). Again, I don\'t even know why there would be a conflict, so it wouldn\'t seem to matter so much which strategy is used. Any advice or insight would be helpful, but mostly I just want to get this squashing working.\nUpdated with extra information from discussion with Jefromi:\nBefore working on our massive ""real"" repository, I used similar scripts on a test repository. It was a very simple repository and the test worked cleanly.\nThe message I get when it fails is:\nFinished one cherry-pick.\n# Not currently on any branch.\nnothing to commit (working directory clean)\nCould not apply 66c45e2... Needed subdir\n\nThis is the first pick after the first squash commit. Running git status yields a clean working directory. If I then do a git rebase --continue, I get a very similar message after a few more commits. If I then do it again, I get another very similar message after a couple dozen commits. If I do it yet again, this time it goes through about a hundred commits, and yields this message:\nAutomatic cherry-pick failed.  After resolving the conflicts,\nmark the corrected paths with \'git add <paths>\', and\nrun \'git rebase --continue\'\nCould not apply f1de3bc... Incremental\n\nIf I then run git status, I get:\n# Not currently on any branch.\n# Changes to be committed:\n#   (use ""git reset HEAD <file>..."" to unstage)\n#\n# modified:   repo/file_A.cpp\n# modified:   repo/file_B.cpp\n#\n# Unmerged paths:\n#   (use ""git reset HEAD <file>..."" to unstage)\n#   (use ""git add/rm <file>..."" as appropriate to mark resolution)\n#\n# both modified:      repo/file_X.cpp\n#\n# Changed but not updated:\n#   (use ""git add/rm <file>..."" to update what will be committed)\n#   (use ""git checkout -- <file>..."" to discard changes in working directory)\n#\n# deleted:    repo/file_Z.imp\n\nThe ""both modified"" bit sounds weird to me, since this was just the result of a pick. It\'s also worth noting that if I look at the ""conflict"", it boils down to a single line with one version beginning it with a [tab] character, and the other one with four spaces. This sounded like it might be an issue with how I\'ve set up my config file, but there\'s nothing of the sort in it. (I did note that core.ignorecase is set to true, but evidently git-clone did that automatically. I\'m not completely surprised by that considering that the original source was on a Windows machine.)\nIf I manually fix file_X.cpp, it then fails shortly afterward with another conflict, this time between a file (CMakeLists.txt) that one version thinks should exist and one version thinks shouldn\'t. If I fix this conflict by saying I do want this file (which I do), a few commits later I get another conflict (in this same file) where now there\'s some rather non-trivial changes. It\'s still only about 25% of the way through the conflicts.\nI should also point out, since this might be very important, that this project started out in an svn repository. That initial history very likely was imported from that svn repository.\nUpdate #2:\nOn a lark (influenced by Jefromi\'s comments), I decided to do the change my repo_squash.sh to be:\nrm -rf repo_squash\ngit clone repo repo_squash\ncd repo_squash/\ngit rebase --strategy theirs -i bd6a09a484b8230d0810e6689cf08a24f26f287a\n\nAnd then, I just accepted the original entries, as is. I.e., the ""rebase"" shouldn\'t have changed a thing. It ended up with the same results describe previously.\nUpdate #3:\nAlternatively, if I omit the strategy and replace the last command with:\ngit rebase -i bd6a09a484b8230d0810e6689cf08a24f26f287a\n\nI no longer get the ""nothing to commit"" rebase problems, but I\'m still left with the other conflicts.\nUpdate with toy repository that recreates problem:\ntest_squash.sh (this is the file you actually run):\n#========================================================\n# Initialize directories\n#========================================================\nrm -rf test_squash/ test_squash_clone/\nmkdir -p test_squash\nmkdir -p test_squash_clone\n#========================================================\n\n#========================================================\n# Create repository with history\n#========================================================\ncd test_squash/\ngit init\necho ""README"">README\ngit add README\ngit commit -m""Initial commit: can\'t easily access for rebasing""\necho ""Line 1"">test_file.txt\ngit add test_file.txt\ngit commit -m""Created single line file""\necho ""Line 2"">>test_file.txt \ngit add test_file.txt \ngit commit -m""Meant for it to be two lines""\ngit checkout -b dev\necho Meaningful code>new_file.txt\ngit add new_file.txt \ngit commit -m""Meaningful commit""\ngit checkout master\necho Conflicting meaningful code>new_file.txt\ngit add new_file.txt \ngit commit -m""Conflicting meaningful commit""\n# This will conflict\ngit merge dev\n# Fixes conflict\necho Merged meaningful code>new_file.txt\ngit add new_file.txt\ngit commit -m""Merged dev with master""\ncd ..\n\n#========================================================\n# Save off a clone of the repository prior to squashing\n#========================================================\ngit clone test_squash test_squash_clone\n#========================================================\n\n#========================================================\n# Do the squash\n#========================================================\ncd test_squash\nGIT_EDITOR=../test_squash_helper.sh git rebase -i HEAD@{7}\n#========================================================\n\n#========================================================\n# Show the results\n#========================================================\ngit log\ngit gc\ngit reflog\n#========================================================\n\ntest_squash_helper.sh (used by test_sqash.sh):\n# If the file has the phrase ""pick "" in it, assume it\'s the log file\nif grep -q ""pick "" $1\nthen\n  sed -e ""s/pick \\(.*\\) \\(Meant for it to be two lines\\)/squash \\1 \\2/g"" < $1 > $1.tmp\n  mv $1.tmp $1\n# Else, assume it\'s the commit message file\nelse\n# Use our pre-canned message\n  echo ""Created two line file"" > $1\nfi\n\nP.S.: Yes, I know some of you cringe when you see me using emacs as a fall-back editor.\nP.P.S.: We do know we\'ll have to blow away all of our clones of the existing repository after the rebase.

Everything works correctly when only one person is making changes to the file, and his work pushes and merges correctly with the central repository. However, when we have two different people working on the code and making changes at the same time, the last person to push always has to deal with a manual merge when trying to pull the first person's changes, as the automatic one fails. \n    This happens even if the changes we made were unrelated (I.E.

I know that there are programs one can use to help facilitate manual merges, but I wanted to make sure that it wasn't some setting causing this issue. \nThanks!\nEDIT: We are now using a .gitignore file in our repository(this one here), and it seems as though we've made some progress.

"{'abstract': u""Here's our situation :\nWe have 3 different Laravel projects and all 3 projects rely on our Core project.\nThis Core project is a separate Laravel package hosted on our private repo and is used as a dependency for other projects.\nBefore, whenever something would change in the Core project we woud just run a composer update ourvendor/ourcorepackage on our servers for each project to pull in the core changes. However as of lately composer seems to suffer from serious memory issues when we try to run the update on our Digital Ocean staging environment with 512 MB Ram. See : https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/1898\nThe solution I always come across is people saying that you should always run composer install on your production servers. I can relate to that in terms of security because it can be dangerous if you update to a new version of some 3rd party package that can possibly break your code. But in our case we only update our own core package so we know what we're doing but this memory issue forces us to use the composer install method because it is less memory demanding.\nSo basically this is our current workflow :\n\nWhen something changes in our core package we need to run a composer\nupdate ourvendor/ourpackage on each project LOCALLY This generates a\ncomposer.lock file\nWe commit the composer.lock file in our repo\nOn the servers for each project we run a git pull and run a composer\ninstall. This will only update our core package and runs much faster\nand has no memory issues vs composer update\n\nHowever this solution raises 2 issues :\n\nSince we're working with multiple devs on the same project we sometimes end up having merge conflicts for the composer.lock file when pulling in the changes locally.\nRunning a git pull on the server gives an error : Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge: composer.lock\nPlease, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.\n\nSo what am I supposed to do here? Before the pull on the server remove the composer.lock file?\nHow should we handle the merge conflicts for the composer.lock file?\nIt's a shame that composer update suffers from memory issues because that method seems much more logical.

"{'abstract': u'This is an issue in XCode in which the built-in source control feature is unable to load the repository for projects located within a directory named with ALL-CAPS, such as ~/Documents/CODE.  Running XCode 4.0.2 on a 2008 black macbook.  If anyone has insight, please share.\nThis was the issue.\nI create a new project, save it to the directory ~/Documents/CODE/...here-or-a-subdirectory-therein, making sure to check the ""create local git repository"" checkbox.  I make a small edit to the AppDelegate or any other file, and Source Control commits will not work from within XCode.  From the command-line, I see that .git was created in the project directory, and that the \'first commit\' occurred.  I can perform git commits from the command-line. \nPossibly related issue: In Organizer->repositories, all my repositories have the yellow stoplight icon (even those I\'ve gotten to work).  \nThis was the Error:\nWhen I try to commit from the project window (File-->SourceControl-->Commit, type a comment, and press commit) I get the following error:\n\nThe Working copy of ""MyProjectName"" failed to commit files.\n  fatal: \'/Users/myUserName/Documents/CODE/MyProjectName/MyProjectName/MyProjectNameAppDelegate.m\' is outside repository.\n\nOver in the Organizer, I select MyProjectName (with the drop-down arrow and icon of the repository safe).  The location is displayed as /Users/myUserName/Documents/CODE/MyProjectName/\nBut in the area where the commit comments are normally displayed, I see the message:\n\nUnable to load revisions.\n\nThe likely cause was that XCode was internally identifying the Project directory as ~/Documents/Code, not ~/Documents/CODE.\nOne way to resolve the issue was to rename ~/Documents/CODE to ~/Documents/Code, then in Organizer (select the Repositories Tab) I deleted the repository listing for MyProjectName. \nNOTE - Only removes XCode\'s reference to the repository, the actual repository remains intact.  Now Close XCode and Reopen it.  Open the project MyProjectName.  XCode will recreate a reference to the Project with the correct Capitalization.  Note that the renaming of the directory seems to force XCode to recognize the new directory name when the repository is recreated.\nAnother way to resolve the issue is: within XCode\'s Organizer window (select the Repositories Tab), delete the reference to the repository.  Then, still in Organizer, select the ""Projects"" tab at top.  To the left of the project\'s window is a list of all the projects...select MyProjectName.  Now in the center frame is a field named ""Derived Data"" with a path to your project.  Click the little -> arrow to the right of the PATH to open up the Project\'s Internal Settings Directory in Finder.  Open the file called ""info.plist"" and edit the key ""WorkspacePath"" such that it\'s value EXACTLY MATCHES the location of your project (correct the capitalization of the directory if necessary).  Save, and return to Organizer.  Close XCode.  Reopen XCode and the repository reference will be recreated.  You can go directly into Organizer now, select the ""Repositories"" tab, then select MyProjectName\'s repository.  You\'ll see the commit messages there (even if you haven\'t committed yet, you\'ll still see the auto-generated \'first-commit\' that occurred internally when your project was created).', 'link': u'http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6377684/xcode-4-0-2-git-commit-error-fatal-is-outside-repository-possible-bug', 'title': u""Xcode 4.0.2 Git Commit Error: fatal: '\u2026' is outside repository (Possible Bug)""}"

During my first commit on XC7, I got the error that the commit failed due to failing to build trees (full error provided in above link). I've tried a few things, including what was suggested in the response to my previous thread, but it did not work. I've also tried going into XC and clicking on Source Control->App Name->master->Switch to Branch and then selecting the master branch thinking this would get me back to master branch. When doing that I got an error: Failed to write reference 'refs/heads/master': a reference with that name already exists. (-4).\nI am completely stuck and really need to get past this. Can someone please help provide an alternate solution? Can I just download the current code from git and start a new XCode project? I'm using cocoa pods so I launch the project from the projectname.xcworkspace file...would it cause issues if I tried starting a new porject?

First, the \'fatal: pathspec\' message from git rm is both unhelpful and misleading (in this vanilla user\'s opinion). Second, I had the file in .gitignore, but had removed it before asking my question. However, it was also included in IDEA\'s Ignored Files feature independently of git, and showed as such in the project viewer (instead of untracked, as git status showed). Finally, I had IDEA running while I was experimenting, and it looks like it was recreating the file immediately after my rm. So, my takeaway is that if I\'m getting confusing Git behavior, make sure to quit IDEA and work soley in the command line (and gitk) while debugging. And that SO users are awesome.

"{'abstract': u'I\'m working on a project where we\'d like to edit the LESS files that came with Twitter Bootstrap. The standard advice is to leave those files untouched, to make it easier to upgrade Bootstrap. But that advice isn\'t working for us; our code is becoming fragile and hard to maintain.\nIt seems like it should be possible to solve this with git subtree merging: We could edit Bootstrap\'s LESS files to have clear, maintainable code, then use git\'s merge tools to bring in new versions of Bootstrap.\nWe\'ve come up with a plan for using subtree merging. But before we put the plan into action, I\'d like to get some feedback: Are there significant drawbacks that we\'ve overlooked? Is there a better/simpler approach?\nApproaches with significant drawbacks\nIn the simplest approach to subtree merging, all the commits from the subtree (i.e., Bootstrap) are merged into your project\'s master branch. The drawback is that Bootstrap has so many commits, our commits get lost in the noise. We\'d like to keep their commits off our master branch. \nIn theory, we could use git rebase -i to squash all the Bootstrap commits into one commit, that we then merge into master. But rebase -i does not work well with merges. \n@Sigi helpfully suggested that we use squash merges to go from bootstrap-upstream to master. Grabbing the initial version of Bootstrap (v3.1.0) worked OK. But when we merged in the next version (v3.1.1), we over 100 merge conflicts. Every Bootstrap change between 3.1.0 and 3.1.1 was flagged as a conflict. (Our exact steps are in this gist.)\nThe plan\nOur plan is to use a branch, merge-from-bootstrap, for pulling Bootstrap commits into our repository. When merging changes in to merge-from-bootstrap (either our changes on master, or Bootstrap\'s changes), always record the merge. When merging out from merge-from-bootstrap to master, use git merge --squash so that the merge is not recorded. \nOur hope is that:\n\nmaster stays managable, because the Bootstrap commits never become part of that branch.\nGit has as much information as possible when merging in a new version of Bootstrap, since the merge-from-bootstrap branch has the full history of our changes and the Bootstrap team\'s changes.\n\nProof of concept\nIn the following steps, we grab Bootstrap v3.1.0, make some changes, and then upgrade to v3.1.1. The POC seems to work well (as did my tests with our real repo), but I\'d like to know if we\'re setting ourselves up for trouble down the line.\nStart with a new repo, where the only file is README.md (i.e., the new repo that GitHub gives you).\n# Add bootstrap as a remote\ngit remote add bootstrap https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git\n# Only fetch the master branch; don\'t fetch tags\ngit config remote.bootstrap.fetch +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/bootstrap/master\ngit config remote.bootstrap.tagopt --no-tags\ngit fetch bootstrap\n\n# Start with Bootstrap v3.1.0\ngit checkout -b merge-from-bootstrap\n# SHA is the commit tagged v3.1.0 from the bootstrap repo\ngit merge -s ours --no-commit 1409cde7e800ca83fd761f87e5ad8f0d259e38d1\ngit read-tree -u --prefix=bootstrap/ 1409cde7e800ca83fd761f87e5ad8f0d259e38d1\ngit commit -am ""Bootstrap v3.1.0""\n\n# Merge Bootstrap 3.1.0 to master\ngit checkout master\ngit merge --squash merge-from-bootstrap\ngit commit -am ""Merge bootstrap v3.1.0 to master""\n\n# Make some changes on master, so that we have something to\n# be merged\nsed -e \'s/= space/= force-merge-conflict/g\' -i \'\' bootstrap/.editorconfig\ngit commit -am ""Force a merge conflict""\nsed -e \'s/""Helvetica Neue""/""Comic Sans""/g\' -i \'\' bootstrap/less/variables.less \ngit commit -am ""Comic Sans""\n\n# Get ready to upgrade to the new version of Bootstrap\ngit checkout merge-from-bootstrap\ngit merge -s recursive -Xtheirs master\n\n# Merge in Bootstrap v3.1.1 from bootstrap/master to\n# merge-to-bootstrap.
