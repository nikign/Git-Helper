"Why does my 'git branch' have no master?I'm a git newbie and I keep reading about a ""master"" branch. Is ""master"" just a conventional name that people used or does it have special meaning like HEAD?When I do git branch on the clone that I have, I only see 1 single branch - the one I'm on. No ""master"" at all. If I type git checkout master (as I see in alot of tutorials or guides), I geterror: pathspec 'master' did not match any file(s) known to git.I'm just confused as to why my clone doesn't have a master that everyone seems to imply that it always exists."

"Does Git Add have a verbose switchI am in the process of moving all my private an public repo's over to github. One of the decisions I have made is to only use the console as it means a smaller tooling footprint if I ever need to change PCs, etc.I would be a huge user of console applications and being new to git I decided to purchase Tekpub's Mastering Git series since it shows you how to intergrate git bash as a toolbar.Everything is working fine except for the add all command which is:git add .It seems to be working but I don't get any indication of it working or not.

"Fixing ‰ÛÏpatch does not apply‰Ûù when editing a hunk from git add -pI've made a bunch of changes to a code file, and do git add -p path/to/file.hpp to inspect the diff before I stage it.To summarize my changes: I've converted a regular class declaration to a template class definition. In doing so, I've taken a large chunk of code from the bottom of the file and moved it to the top (an exception class that now needed to be defined before the class), and then I've replaced a bunch of one-liners (method declarations) with a few lines of code each (method implementations).Git wasn't able to detect the context of my changes correctly, and basically had deleted and added lines in a big mish-mash, where there wasn't necessarily any connection at all between two lines next to each other in the diff. In order to make the changes easier to inspect later, I shifted around a bunch of changes to get them in context, but was careful to keep all added and removed lines in the same order, keep number of lines added and deleted unchanged and so on.When I was done, I got the error messageerror: patch failed: include/aof/physics/magnetic-field.hpp:143error: include/aof/physics/magnetic-field.hpp: patch does not applyYour edited hunk does not apply.

"Adding a new directory to a GitHub repository branch and merging back to the trunkI'm having trouble merging a branch back to the trunk after adding a new directory.I created a new branch BUG_BRANCH, made a few code changes, added a directory, and added several files to that directory.  I used ""git add ."" to add my changes for committing to my local branch. Then ""git commit -am 'message here'"". I then pushed my branch up to GitHub ""git push origin BUG_BRANCH"", checked out the main development branch again ""git checkout dev"", and grabbed any changes that had happened since I'd created my branch ""git pull origin dev"".My problem occurred when I tried to merge the changes from my BUG_BRANCH to dev ""git merge BUG_BRANCH"". For each file within the newly created directory, I got ""error: cannot stat 'path': Permission denied"". When I log into GitHub, I see my changes hanging out in the remote copy of my branch. But I can't merge them into dev, and I can't even seem to get back to BUG_BRANCH locally; I get the same error message.Looking around on StackOverflow, it seems that I could have added the directory using the -A option of add if I could get back to my branch.

"Update file on git add with clean filter and sedI have a small header at the top of some of my project files that I want to make sure are updated with the current year every time I make a change to them. I'm having an issue with my clean filter in git throwing an error:First, I have a file called testClass.cs on my master branch:// *********************// File active 2011-2014// *********************I then make a small change to the file:// *********************// File active 2011-2014// *********************// First commit, wahoo!then I run git add testClass.cs to stage the change for the next commit. This runs my git clean filter that uses sed to attempt to edit the file inplace to update the year in the header to 2015 (ie, 2011-2014 should be changed to 2011-2015). Here is the config, with the filter setting:[core]    repositoryformatversion = 0    filemode = false    bare = false    logallrefupdates = true    symlinks = false    ignorecase = true    hideDotFiles = dotGitOnly[filter ""updatedate""]    clean = sed -i ""s/2011-[[:digit:]]\\{4\\}/2011-$(date '+%Y')/"" %fThe issue that I am having, is that the add/update fails due to a ""Device or resource busy"" error.

"Git Push Error: insufficient permission for adding an object to repository databaseWhen I try to push to a shared git remote, I get the following error:insufficient permission for adding an object to repository databaseThen I read about a fix here: Fix  This worked for the next push, since all of the files were of the correct group, but the next time someone pushed up a change it made a new item in the objects folder that had their default group as the group.

"GIT: Can't Push (Strange Config Issue)I'm on a fresh install of Linux Mint.I'm getting the following error when trying to push from any repository:error: Malformed value for push.default: simpleerror: Must be one of nothing, matching, tracking or current.fatal: bad config file line 8 in /home/leng/.gitconfigfatal: Could not read from remote repository.This is very odd, because I definitely have a version that supports the simple push behavior.The output of git --version is git version 1.8.3.2.The contents of ~/.gitconfig:[user]    name = My Name    email = MyEmail@website.com[color]    ui = true[push]    default = simpleHere's where it gets creepy.If I change the behavior to matching (or to nothing, tracking, or current, for that matter), then attempt to push, I get the same exact error message.  How is that possible?  Is it caching the config somehow?  I've even tried rebooting.  I've even tried purging GIT completely from the system (and deleting ~/.gitconfig) then reinstalling it.If I delete the [push] section completely from the .gitconfig file (or if I delete the file entirely), then try to push, then I get this:Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this messageand maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:  git config --global push.default matchingTo squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:  git config --global push.default simpleSee 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)error: Malformed value for push.default: simpleerror: Must be one of nothing, matching, tracking or current.fatal: bad config file line 8 in /home/leng/.gitconfigfatal: Could not read from remote repository....so it appears to be both acknowledging that I haven't chosen a pushing behavior, but then also saying that I've chosen an unsupported behavior.  What on earth is going on here?I even get the error if I delete ~/.gitconfig completely.Can anyone help me out with this witchcraft?Thanks!EDIT:Here is a .git/config file requested:[core]        repositoryformatversion = 0        filemode = true        bare = false        logallrefupdates = true[remote ""origin""]        url = ssh://{my remote repo}        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*[branch ""master""]        remote = origin        merge = refs/heads/master"

"Git's famous ‰ÛÏERROR: Permission to .git denied to user‰ÛùI have tried googling and read through http://help.github.com/troubleshooting-ssh/ and various, various guides. I am unable to git push -u origin master or git push origin master ( the same command ).I've had my git account for at least 2 or so years. I've successfully been able to create repos and push -u origin master fine on my laptop but on this desktop I'm having issues.Here's what I tried:1. I have setup my git user name2. I have setup my git user email3. I have uploaded the contents of my /home/meder/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to github's account page. I have verified I did not paste any whitespace4. I have created a ~/.ssh/config with these contents:  Host github.com  User git  Hostname github.com  PreferredAuthentications publickey  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsaI have chmodded the .ssh to 700, id_rsa 6005. I have added the proper remote origin without making typos : git remote add origin git@github.com:medero/cho.git6. To confirm #5, here is my .git/config. The directory is correct and not another directory:[remote ""origin""]        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*        url = git@github.com:medero/cho.git7. ssh git@github.com -v gives me a successful Authentication8. One weird thing is, the username which it greets me with has t appended to it. My github username is medero, not medert.Hi mederot! You've successfully  authenticated, but GitHub does not  provide shell access.9. I am not behind a proxy or firewall10. The key is offered, heres the output from -v:debug1: Host 'github.com' is known and matches the RSA host key.debug1: Found key in /home/meder/.ssh/known_hosts:58debug1: ssh_rsa_verify: signature correctdebug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sentdebug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYSdebug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS receiveddebug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sentdebug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT receiveddebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickeydebug1: Next authentication method: publickeydebug1: Offering public key: /home/meder/.ssh/id_rsadebug1: Remote: Forced command: gerve mederotdebug1: Remote: Port forwarding disabled.debug1: Remote: X11 forwarding disabled.debug1: Remote: Agent forwarding disabled.debug1: Remote: Pty allocation disabled.debug1: Server accepts key: { some stuff, dont know if i should share itdebug1: Remote: Forced command: gerve mederotdebug1: Remote: Port forwarding disabled.debug1: Remote: X11 forwarding disabled.debug1: Remote: Agent forwarding disabled.debug1: Remote: Pty allocation disabled.debug1: Authentication succeeded (publickey).11. Here are the commands I usedmkdir chogit inittouch READMEgit add READMEgit commit -m 'test'git remote add origin git@github.com:medero/cho.gitgit push -u origin master12. I don't want to create a new SSH key.13. If I git clone using ssh and make an edit, commit, and git push, I get the same exact thing.14. Here's the actual error:$ git pushERROR: Permission to medero/cho.git denied to mederot.fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly15. I have setup my github username and github token:$ git config --global github.user medero$ git config --global github.token 0123456789yourf0123456789tokenSets the GitHub token for all git instances on the system16. I have confirmed my github username is NOT mederot and my github token IS CORRECT per my account page ( validated first 2 chars and last 2 chars ).17. To confirm #16, ~/.gitconfig contains[github]    token = mytoken...    user = medero18. I did ssh-key add ~/.ssh/id_rsa if that's even necessary...THEORIES:I suspect there's something fishy because when I get ssh authenticated, the user greeting is mederot and not medero, which is my acct. Could something in my github account possibly be incorrectly cached?I also suspect some local ssh caching weirdness because if i mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa KAKA and mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub POOPOO, and do ssh git@github.com -v, it still Authenticates me and says it serves my /home/meder/.ssh/id_rsa when I renamed it?! It has to be cached?!"

"Git push rejected after feature branch rebaseOK, I thought this was a simple git scenario, what am I missing?I have a master branch and a feature branch. I do some work on master, some on feature, and then some more on master. I end up with something like this (lexicographic order implies order of commits):A--B--C------F--G  (master)       \            D--E  (feature)I have no problem to git push origin master to keep the remote master updated, nor with git push origin feature (when on feature) in order to maintain a remote backup for my feature work. Up until now, we're good.But now I wanna rebase feature on top of the F--G commits on master, so I git checkout feature and git rebase master. Still good. Now we have:A--B--C------F--G  (master)                 \                  D'--E'  (feature)Problem: the moment I want to backup the new rebased feature branched with git push origin feature, the push is rejected since the tree has changed due to the rebasing. This can only be solved with git push --force origin feature.I hate using --force without being sure I need it. So, do I need it? Does the rebasing necessarily imply that the next push should be --forceful?This feature branch is not shared with any other devs, so I have no problem de facto with the forced push, I'm not gonna lose any data, the question is more conceptual."
"Can't push a git repo on a local serverI have a local Git server set up on my network, but I'm having issues committing my project code to it.Here are the steps I've tried so far:Using visual studio 2013 a create a new project.  Then while still inside the IDE I right click on my solution in the solution explorer and I add the solution to source control.

I create this project on my local server machine which is at address 192.168.0.1Once everything is set up, I commit the project into my source control system and push the changes.I then close the solution that I've just committed, and close visual studio.I then move to a different machine (Where I want to work on my project) open visual studio 2013, open Team explorer and clone the project that I just created in previous steps.I use the following settings to clone this new project:Git repo to clone : 192.168.0.1/GitTest/Test1Where to clone : C:/Users/Me/Desktop/GitTest/Once I click on the clone button, everything works as I expect, the solution is created on the new machine, the files I initially created and everything looks ok.The previously cloned project opens fine in visual studio and I see exactly what I expect to see in my solution explorer.My next step is to add some code to the project, I do this in the usual manner of adding new items and typing in some code, then saving it.Once I have some code to commit, I go back into the Team Explorer, I find my list of changes and a click on the required buttons to commit them.It's at this point where things start to fail.In Un-Synced commits section I click on the button labeled push and I'm immediately presented with an error message stating the following:An error occurred.

The error somehow misled me to think that there was something wrong with the bare repository, as I could clone and push branch by branch just fine from ""regular"" clones.As it turns out, this is a bug in MSysGit.  I moved to Linux because retaining all of the history was a requirement, in my case.  I couldn't simply remove branches and tags, as these needed to be pushed to the empty remote repo.

"Git push fails to github: failed to read objectThe story:I've been developing a RoR-app in both my desktop and laptop. It was quite handy to commit changes made on another, push them to github and fetch & merge on other.The starting point is this: I committed latest changes on my desktop, pushed them to github and then fetched and merged them into my laptop. Then, I made some commits on laptop and pushed to github. Took the changes, merged to my desktop (with --no-ff). THEN, happened the probable source of all mischiefs: I reverted the desktop to commit where it was before the latest fetch & merge. Made some development work with it, committed, pushed to github. In the laptop, I did the revert as well, though I reverted it to a commit which was made somewhere between the latest fetch from github, fetched again and merged those. Some error messages came after reverting desktop and laptop both, but things worked still fairly well and I kept working on both machines.Until now. I tried to push from my laptop to github, which gives the following output:         Counting objects: 106, done. error: unable to find 5a2a4ac... error: unable to find bc36923... error: unable to find ecb0d86...  error: unable to find f76d194... error: unable to find f899df7... Compressing objects: 100% (64/64), done. fatal: failed to read object 5a2a4ac... : Invalid argument error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github:username/repo.git'So, the question is, what exactly took place here?EDIT: It seems that because of suspending my laptop and moving it from place to place in that state screwed up the hard drive somehow. The fsck output is unavailable because we worked around the problem and kept on working, but IIRC some branches and commits were dangling, including that commit which git failed to read. - Teemu"
"‰ÛÏFatal: bad object‰Ûù error using git subtree pushThis is a noob question but I'm under the gun to resolve this. I've inherited an odd problem with a git subtree that appears to be repo corruption.Here's the scenario : a subtree of a git-based project A is being used in project B. Part of the deploy script use pushes the subtree out to project B's repo:git subtree push -P sub/path/name --squash git@github.com:MyCo/project_b.git projectb_branchit starts pushing the commits and fails with ""fatal: bad object {sha}"" I've searched for the SHA in the source repo's git log. It shows up in a commit:git-subtree-dir: app/assets/uigit-subtree-split: {sha}The target repo (project_b) does indeed have a commit with that SHA but the source repo does not. I walked through the subtree shell script I can see that it's failing when it tries to look up that object with git log (in the toptree_for_commit function calling git log -l --pretty=format:'%T' {sha}).At this point I am in way over my head but eager to try to find a solution.

"Why is my git push returning with fatal error?What I am Trying To DoThis is my initial setup and I have not not made a successful push or pull on this server, I have verified that I can add files to a repository and that git is working inside a repo by making changes and seeing it track the files, but I am finding that pushing and pulling to the server or even on the server does not work yet.   I installed git on Centos on a Godaddy.com dedicated server successfully, this took awhile but I finally figured it out.I followed these instructions when setting up a web focused workflow with the exception that I would prefer having a place to test what has been pushed to the server before I push it to our production folder. http://joemaller.com/990/a-web-focused-git-workflow/I have developed a php/mysql application that I have tar balled and uploaded from my mac to my server and un-tarred it to folder called it 'marketing' under public_html.Then I initialized marketing as a git repo, and copied that folder to a folder called 'devmarketing' at the same folder level of our server.I ran git init in the devmarketing folder, this re-initialized it as a repo since it was a copy of a repo.Then I created some bare repositories that I will explain below.The structure looks like this:Bare repository that I want to auto update a testing folder ( public_html/devmarketing/ ) when I push to it:/samiam/dev_market_hub.gitBare repository that I want to auto update a production folder  ( public_html/marketing/ ) when I push from devmarketing:/samiam/market_hub.gitI set some hooks on the repositories (bare and the other) like the link above suggested, but I can't tell if it is really working or not.I encountered an error when pushing from my devmarketing branch to my marketing branch:nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use ""git add"" to track)root@ip-XX-XXX-XXX-XXX [/home/samiam/public_html/devmarketing]# git push master finalfatal: 'master' does not appear to be a git repositoryfatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedlyroot@ip-XX-XXX-XXX-XXX [/home/samiam/public_html/devmarketing]# git push finalNo refs in common and none specified;

"Git pull suddenly stopped working, troubleshooting ‰ÛÏRepository not found‰ÛùI have been using git to push my local code to a server. I have a local remote that is called ""origin"" and I have a remote on the server that's called ""github"". Typically, after committing, I use ""git push origin master"" to push the local code to github. Next I ssh into the server and use ""git pull github master"" to pull the github code onto the server. This has been working for a couple of weeks. However, yesterday when I went to pull code to my server from github, I got the following error:python$ git pull github masterERROR: Repository not found.fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedlyI went back to my local computer and tried a ""git push origin master"" and  it worked fine. I also tried a ""git pull origin master"" and it also worked, so clearly the repo exists. So I decided there might be an issue with my remote on the server. I checked the remotes (using ""git remote -v"") and they match the remotes on my local computer exactly, with the exception of having different remote names. How else should I go about troubleshooting this?EDITI know there probably isn't a simple solution to this. I'm fairly new to git and github though, so I'm wondering about the best ways to troubleshoot this. Should I try and destroy my git and run another git init? Are there any other suggestions about what might be the problem?EDIT 2So now there error has become:python$ git pull github masterPermission denied (publickey).fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedlyI decided to try to initialize a git in another directory, add a new remote and do a pull from the new directory. I ended up with the same result. I'm guessing I can fix this by fixing my keys. My local git and keys are still working, could I possibly grab my keys from my local repo and put them on the server?"

"Git through a Proxy. What is causing the 407 error when cloning?I'm trying to use Git through a proxy.

I commit often.go to other work site b (usually office)clone repository at site bthis is done within visual studio, by going to Team Explorer -> Projects -> Connect to Team Projects, and then using Clone with the github repository URL.redownload nuget packages, etc - resume work as normal at site b for the dayI perform frequent commits here, as well.return home (site a) and open up Visual Studio 2013open up the project I was working ongo to Team Explorer -> Unsynched Commits and click Pullsometimes it workssometimes, however, I receive the following error and I have no idea whyI would understand this if I had made edits to the current project before trying to pull - but I haven't. All I've done is loaded up Visual Studio. It says ""See the Output window for details"" but the Output window is completely blank - there are no details, and in this situation the only answer I've found is to delete the WHOLE project from my computer and clone the entire repository again.Certainly this isn't right, I'm a complete newbie to git, and I have read the documentation over and over and this still makes no sense to me.

"Why does git-pull fail with signal 13?SetupI've written a small script to do automatic pull/commit/push for some personal data. This script works great on my laptop (version 1.8.3.2-1) but on my server, the git pull command is failing with signal 13. I was running version 1.7.9.5-1 (these are both ubuntu, but the server is 12.04.4 LTS vs 13.10 on the laptop), I used the ppa:git-core repo to update git to 1.9.0-1~ppa0~precise1. This still gives the same problem with my script. The complication perhaps, is that the laptop pulls from a bare repo on the server over ssh while the server pulls from the same bare repo (to a working copy elsewhere) but doesn't use ssh, it just has the local path.The problemI can reproduce the problem in the terminal with the following command:> git pull origin master | read msg; echo ${msg}First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...error: git-pull died of signal 13This seems to fetch the commit and check it out, but does not update the master branch and leaves the repo off branch:> git status# Not currently on any branch.nothing to commit (working directory clean)Switching back to master gives a warning:> git checkout masterWarning: you are leaving 1 commit behind, not connected toany of your branches:  7220b8f Commit messageIf you want to keep them by creating a new branch, this may be a good timeto do so with: git branch new_branch_name 7220b8f5e2648ae49d3e3095e8bf942dfc41421cSwitched to branch 'master'My attempts to fixThinking the problem was due to stdout being a pipe but stderr being a tty, I tried:> git pull origin master 2>&1 | read msg; echo ${msg}But this does nothing at all and leaves ${msg} empty.What does work is:> git pull --quiet origin master 2>&1 | read msg; echo ${msg}> git pull --quiet origin master> git pull origin masterAll of which do fetch the commit and update master. I'd like to capture output from git-pull in some cases so while I can fix up the repo, I'd like to know why this is happening.So why can't I capture the output of git-pull, and why does it crash out leaving the repo in such a state?"

The real root of the problem was that my colleague removed some entries from the .gitignore file in his branch that allowed several new files to come into his checkin.  Since my local .gitignore was still ignoring those files, my local repo didn't think I had local working files to add to the index.  I ended up deleting all the files and then the pull worked and  brought them all in.I'm definitely going to be more careful editing the .gitignore file and checking it in. I now have some new appreciation for its affect on other developers."

"Git Checkout warning: unable to unlink files, permission deniedI am aware that there are similar issues about git relating to the 'unable to unlink' warning, but I have not been able to use them.The main difference is that this happened when I have not been dealing with submodules in any way (I have never dealt with them before).  I created a branch called 'upgrade', deleted my old framework files, and copied in the new ones.  I used git add -A, then committed everything.  When I tried to checkout the trunk branch, it responded with the following errors:warning: unable to unlink requirements/views/sk/index.php: Permission deniedwarning: unable to unlink requirements/views/sv/index.php: Permission deniedwarning: unable to unlink requirements/views/zh/index.php: Permission deniedwarning: unable to unlink requirements/views/zh_cn/index.php: Permission deniedwarning: unable to unlink requirements/views/zh_tw/index.php: Permission denied...etc.  There are hundreds of them.At first I thought this was simply a permissions problem, and so I added group write permissions to the entire requirements directory recursively, but there was no change.Edit: As suggested in an answer below, I attempted to do the same thing but with everything else closed.  I had no more luck than before.This issue is particularly debilitating as I cannot move to trunk to get back to normal development.Thanks a lot,Daniel Moniz"

"git pull - can't submit merge message [duplicate]Possible Duplicate:github locks up mac terminal when using pull command I am using git via the terminal on the mac.I have encountered an annoying problem recently when I try to perform git pull.After performing git pull I receive the following error message:Merge ssh://domain.com/repository.git# Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary,# especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch.## Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts:# the commit.The issue is that I can't enter anything. My terminal seems stuck and there isn't anything I seem to be able to do about it. I am reasonably new to git so it may be a simple mistake I am making.I read here that for some people the text editor opens at this point. This certainly isn't the case at my end.

"Undoing a bad pullFirst of all, Git sucks.  I know, I know, it's supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread, but it sucks.  It's like trying to shave with a chainsaw: one slight mistake and there are blood and teeth everywhere.  Perhaps, if I could actually make an exact distinction between a head, a ref, a commit, a branch, a stem, a gnargel, and a whizpoo, some of this might be a little easier but to an ordinary mortal with only 10 years experience of SVN, Perforce, and RCS, it all looks like rather cranky black magic.Now for some reason, git pull has never worked for me.  I get a 10-line error message that has been, so far, about as helpful as the word ""error"".   Googling the error message produced a wide array of suggestions that only had in common the fact that they had no apparent affect whatsoever. But that's not today's problem: I've gotten used to typing git pull origin branch.Today, I was flipping back and forth between two branches, ""master"" and ""lounge"" and at the moment I was in the master branch.  I wanted to get the latest changes from the remote repository to the local one, but I mistyped.  Instead of writing git pull origin master, I wrote git pull origin lounge and then, without thinking, typed in the correct command.  There's no evidence of the first (bad) pull in log, just two merges from the master:commit 0c6be9569bab0581244ea8603bf2edfee82cdd7bMerge: 43fdec5... db09f0d...Author: Malvolio <info@xcompanyx.com>Date:   Wed Nov 24 20:38:58 2010 -0500Merge branch 'master' of github.com:xcompanyx/xRepositoryXcommit db09f0d79d744d6a354142041b47ff5d748999f3Merge: 81b6c3d... fc73e25...Author: Malvolio <info@xcompanyx.com>Date:   Wed Nov 24 17:38:16 2010 -0800Merge branch 'master' of github.com:xcompanyx/xRepositoryXcommit 81b6c3d04b7c464f8750a56282635526a5ef83a1Author: Michael <info@xcompanyx.com>Date:   Wed Nov 24 17:38:07 2010 -0800    the last commit I didBut files newly created in the lounge branch are there in my repository.So now I'm fscked, right?  Should I just torch my repository, clone the remote again, reapply all the unpushed changes manually, and chalk it up to Git sucking or is there some incantation I can recite that will make it all better?  Would it help if I sacrificed a goat?"

Grateful for any advice - maxEDIT - I've since discovered that this is due to dreamhost killing the push due to excessive memory consumption (i did this by copying my app folder to the repo server on dreamhost and doing the push from there).  I've found some pages, - that talk about a NO_MMAP=1 option in git to help prevent this, but they talk about it in terms of configuring git when it's installed.  Can i set this option in an existing git install?  Is it part of the config for the git-inited app that's doing the push or is it part of the config for the repo?EDIT 2 - following the instructions on the page above, I downloaded and made my own local git binaries, with the NO_MMAP=1 option set. I made sure these were before the dreamhost-installed versions in my path, and ""which git"" shows my local version, so far so good.  But, i get exactly the same problem. Do i need to do something with my repo to make the NO_MMAP option work, or is the problem something else do you think?"

What am I missing? Is my repository broken? How can I fix this?"

"Git Checkout warning: unable to unlink files, permission deniedI am aware that there are similar issues about git relating to the 'unable to unlink' warning, but I have not been able to use them.The main difference is that this happened when I have not been dealing with submodules in any way (I have never dealt with them before).  I created a branch called 'upgrade', deleted my old framework files, and copied in the new ones.  I used git add -A, then committed everything.  When I tried to checkout the trunk branch, it responded with the following errors:warning: unable to unlink requirements/views/sk/index.php: Permission deniedwarning: unable to unlink requirements/views/sv/index.php: Permission deniedwarning: unable to unlink requirements/views/zh/index.php: Permission deniedwarning: unable to unlink requirements/views/zh_cn/index.php: Permission deniedwarning: unable to unlink requirements/views/zh_tw/index.php: Permission denied...etc.  There are hundreds of them.At first I thought this was simply a permissions problem, and so I added group write permissions to the entire requirements directory recursively, but there was no change.Edit: As suggested in an answer below, I attempted to do the same thing but with everything else closed.  I had no more luck than before.This issue is particularly debilitating as I cannot move to trunk to get back to normal development.Thanks a lot,Daniel Moniz"

"Unresolvable Git error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkoutI am using Git alone for my local software project in Visual Studio 2010. Recently I created a new branch to do a larger refactoring of one of the dialogue windows. I did the following modifications:Rename Form1 to Form1a (including all depending files)Add new Form1I checked this change into the branch, say form-refactoring. Interestingly, Git didn't notice that I renamed the file Form1.cs into Form1a.cs and created a brand new, totally different Form1.cs, but instead it noticed a new Form1a.cs file and found a whole lot of differences between the previous and new Form1.cs files. This will of course lead to totally garbaged diffs, but I don't care in this case as long as all files are handled correctly in the end.Then I switched back to master to do some other small changes. Nothing conflicting. Until now, everything worked fine.Today, I wanted to switch back to my branch form-refactoring to continue that work. But all I get is the following message:git.exe checkout    form-refactoringAbortingerror: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:Form1.Designer.csPlease move or remove them before you can switch branches.What is that supposed to be?

What would happen if I delete it, is it gone for good then? I don't trust Git to bring back the correct file if I delete something now. I did not play with any file at all outside of my mentioned Git operations, so why should I play around with any file to continue using Git operations now?

"Is it possible to do a sparse checkout without checking out the whole repository first?I'm working with a repository with a very large number of files that takes hours to checkout.

"Why does git checkout <remote_branchname> not create new tracking branch?TLDR: If X exists as a remote branch, then git checkout X should create a local branch of it. In my case, for a single branch, it does not.The remote repository has a master, release, and some other branches (say refactor-update)I do:git clone WHATEVER/repo.gitgit checkout releaseBut I do not get the normal branch switch message, nor is a local branch tracking origin/release created (per the man page for git checkout). I am still on master. Note that if I do git checkout refactor-update everything works as expected.This is reproducible on other computers (though the same platform and likely the same version of git). I have (out of desperation, not because I thought it would work), removed the release branch and replaced it with a backup and master respectively with no change in behaviour (git push origin :release && git push origin master:release)I am stuck for what might be causing the problem. My suspicion is that git checkout doesn't seem to recognize the word release for some reason, which would make it much like executing just git checkout. To try and follow up on this, in another repo I created a release branch to see if it was a reserved word or something, but it is definitely just in this repository.

"Git: unable to create symlink (File name too long)I had pushed a project from linux to bitbucked and then cloned it on windows. Turns out there were two symlinks, which appeared as textfiles on windows. Since I knew where they should point to, I replaced them by copies of their destination files, committed and pushed.Now the butbucket repository looks okay when I look it it from their web interface. However a git clone on my unix machine gives me two messages like:error: unable to create symlink ... (File name too long)and the two files, which were symlinks previously are absent.

"How to force Git to abort a checkout if working directory is not clean (i.e. disregarding the check for conflicts)?When you do a git checkout some_branch, and your working directory is not clean, then Git will check if the checkout will result in any conflicts, and if so it will abort with:$ git checkout some_brancherror: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        some_filePlease, commit your changes or stash them before you can switch branches.AbortingHowever, if the checkout will not result in any conflicts, then Git will switch to that new branch and carry over all uncommitted changes (and listing them, polite as Git is).$ git checkout some_branchM       some_fileM       some_other_fileSwitched to branch 'some_branch'So far so good ...Now, not all Git users uses cmd line. If you use an IDE (like e.g. Eclipse) and do a checkout of some_branch with a dirty working directory which will not result in any conflicts, then you will not be nicely notified that the changes you were working on in previous_branch are still present in your working directory after changing to some_branch.I.e. when you compile your code your uncommitted changes from previous_branch are still present in your working directory on some_branch.Question #1:Is it possible to force Git to abort a checkout if working directory is not clean (no matter if there are any conflicts or not)?I would prefer a setting in global Git config.Question #2:If this is not possible to setup, is it then a valid request for a new config option in Git?As I see it Git is very strong in context switching (i.e. working on multiple issues on multiple branches), and I could see a use for a setting which setup a strict check for if working directory is not clean (disregarding the check for conflicts).This would mean that your changes created while on branch #1 will not be carried over when changing to branch #2, i.e. you will work strictly context based always.Any views or opinions on this?"

Surprisingly, I haven't found anyone describing similar behavior.How do I make these errors stop, or diagnose the problem further?I'm specifically looking to end the file access race by identifying whatever process is doing the simultaneous access.  So suggestions for a tool that shows which process has a file locked when an edit is denied would be very helpful.  I'm aware of 'unlocker' and similar tools which will show me what process holds a file locked for a period of time.  This doesn't work for this issue, because the process keeps the file locked for a very short period.  So the tool needs to collect the appropriate data without my intervention, as I'm too slow."

"How do you restore a corrupted object in a git repository (for newbies)?I tried to open my repository today and it came up with no commit history. Everything I tried (git status, git log, git checkout...) threw an error about a corrupt object.I researched this problem online and found the article by Linus Torvalds, but got lost at the point where he found the broken link ID: none of my file IDs, tree or blob, match the culprit ID thrown by the error message.I then returned to the article on recovering ""git objects damaged by hard disk failure"" and (after moving the culprit object out of the way) worked my way through until $ cat packed-refsat which point my computer said: cat: packed-refs: No such file or directoryI skipped that step and did the$ git fsck --fulland got the appropriate output, but then I was supposed to copy the culprit (or what I was referring to as the culprit, the sha1 ID thrown by the error) from a backup repository back into the main repository, then copy the missing objects from the backup repository into the main repository, as far as I can tell; and I don't want to do anything too drastic or I might force something I can't unforce later.So my question(s) is (are), was I supposed to have made a backup (ooh, newbie alert), or was that what happened when I unpacked the .pack file? And is the ""culprit"" I'm copying back actually a clean file, i.e. not corrupted?(I think it only fair to tell you that I was initially confused by a simple dash in Torvalds' file between the ""git"" and ""fsck."" So I'm REALLY new at this.)BUG-LISTOriginal bug:$ git statusfatal: object 016660b7605cfc2da85f631bbe809f7cb7962608 is corruptedBug after moving corrupt object:$ git statusfatal: bad object HEAD$ git fsck --fullerror: HEAD: invalid sha1 pointer 016660b7605cfc2da85f631bbe809f7cb7962608error: refs/heads/RPG does not point to a valid object!dangling tree 2c1033501b82e301d47dbf53ba0a199003af25a8dangling blob 531aca5783033131441ac7e132789cfcad82d06ddangling blob 74a47ff40a8c5149a8701c2f4b29bba408fa36f5dangling blob b8df4d9751c0518c3560e650b21a182ea6d7bd5edangling blob fc2d15aead4bd0c197604a9f9822d265bb986d8b$ git ls-tree 2c1033501b82e301d47dbf53ba0a199003af25a8040000 tree 4a8b0b3747450085b1cd920c22ec82c18d9311bd    folder1040000 tree 33298295f646e8b378299191ce20b4594f5eb625    folder2040000 tree dec82bad6283fc7fcc869c20fdea9f8588a2f1b2    folder3040000 tree 4544967c6b04190f4c95b516ba8a86cab266a872    folder4$ git ls-tree dec82bad6283fc7fcc869c20fdea9f8588a2f1b2100644 blob 67bda6df733f6cd76fc0fc4c8a6132d8015591d8    fileA100644 blob 4cb7272c9e268bfbd83a04e568d7edd87f78589c    fileB100644 blob ce9e0f2cc4d3b656fa30340afbdfed47fe35f3ef    fileC$ git ls-tree 4544967c6b04190f4c95b516ba8a86cab266a872100644 blob d64fe3add8328d81b1f31c9dbd528956ab391fb6    fileD100644 blob d1ebd7df7082abc5190d87caa821bf3edb7b68e8    fileE100644 blob bb6cd264e47a3e5bc7beadf35ea13bac86024b02    ...100644 blob 995d622b9012f4ef69921091d1e1a73f32aa94e6100644 blob 9141dbd2b1c7931a6461195934b6599f5dfb485a 100644 blob ab128da1d82907cd0568448dc089a7996d5f79d3100644 blob 57b11a7eb408a79739d2bb60a0dc35c591340d18100644 blob 118105291c1c6ca4a01744889ffafbb018bc7ed3100644 blob 86b1dfda56d0603f16910228327751f869d16bdc100644 blob 077fe0cddde0d0be9d0974f928f66815caca7b76100644 blob c0b32fd0450f21994bdc53ea83d3cf0bccd74004100644 blob 37b87a4d11453468c4ae04572db5d322cd2d1d80100644 blob 79d39f8d4e57fa3a71664598a63b6dfd88149638100644 blob ee07bbe3e8cb5d6bb79fb0cd52cfbc9bd830498d    files$ git ls-tree 33298295f646e8b378299191ce20b4594f5eb625100644 blob f9d6f45cd028aec97f761f00c5f4f2f6b50fb925    MoreFiles100644 blob 0cb9eed1d0dd9214d54a03af1bda21f37b8c0d02100644 blob 198e4f97ece735cce47b7e99b54f1b5fa99fabf5100644 blob fc004212fa8e483e5a8ab35b508027c7a9a1cbfa100644 blob 0c7d74c7a9a8337b4a9f20802b63d71d42287f89$ git ls-tree 4a8b0b3747450085b1cd920c22ec82c18d9311bd100644 blob 0320f5b23dd7cce677fac60b9ad03f418cff5c88    oneLASTfileAfter moving the corrupted object back:$ git log --raw --allfatal: object 016660b7605cfc2da85f631bbe809f7cb7962608 is corrupted$ cat packed-refscat: packed-refs: No such file or directory$ git fsck --fullfatal: object 016660b7605cfc2da85f631bbe809f7cb7962608 is corruptedAfter moving the file back out:$ git fsck --full`  error: HEAD: invalid sha1 pointer 016660b7605cfc2da85f631bbe809f7cb7962608error: refs/heads/RPG does not point to a valid object!dangling tree 2c1033501b82e301d47dbf53ba0a199003af25a8dangling blob 531aca5783033131441ac7e132789cfcad82d06ddangling blob 74a47ff40a8c5149a8701c2f4b29bba408fa36f5dangling blob b8df4d9751c0518c3560e650b21a182ea6d7bd5edangling blob fc2d15aead4bd0c197604a9f9822d265bb986d8bAfter unpacking the .pack file:$ git logfatal: bad object HEAD$ cat packed-refscat: packed-refs: No such file or directory$ git fsck --fullerror: HEAD: invalid sha1 pointer 016660b7605cfc2da85f631bbe809f7cb7962608error: refs/heads/RPG does not point to a valid object!dangling tree 2c1033501b82e301d47dbf53ba0a199003af25a8dangling blob 531aca5783033131441ac7e132789cfcad82d06ddangling blob 74a47ff40a8c5149a8701c2f4b29bba408fa36f5dangling blob b8df4d9751c0518c3560e650b21a182ea6d7bd5edangling blob fc2d15aead4bd0c197604a9f9822d265bb986d8b"

"Git Svn dcommit error - restart the commitLast week, I made a number of changes to my local branch before leaving town for the weekend. This morning I wanted to dcommit all of those changes to the company's Svn repository, but I get a merge conflict in one file:Merge conflict during commit: Your file or directory 'build.properties.sample' is probably out-of-date: The version resource does not correspond to the resource within the transaction.  Either the requested version resource is out of date (needs to be updated), or the requested version resource is newer than the transaction root (restart the commit).I'm not sure exactly why I'm getting this, but before attempting to dcommit, I did a git svn rebase.  That ""overwrote"" my commits. To recover from that, I did a git reset --hard HEAD@{1}. Now my working copy seems to be where I expect it to be, but I have no idea how to get past the merge conflict; there's not actually any conflict to resolve that I can find.Any thoughts would be appreciated.EDIT: Just wanted to specify that I am working locally. I have a local branch for the trunk that references svn/trunk (the remote branch). All of my work was done on the local trunk:$ git branch  maint-1.0.x  master  * trunk$ git branch -r  svn/maintenance/my-project-1.0.0  svn/trunkSimilarly, git log currently shows 10 commits on my local trunk since the last commit with a Svn ID.Hopefully that answers a few questions.Thanks again."

"Work-around for failing ‰ÛÏgit svn clone‰Ûù (requiring full history)I want to convert a Subversion repository sub-directory (denoted by module here) into a git repository with full history. There are many svn copy operations (Subversion people call them branches) in the history of my Subversion repository. The release policy has been that after each release or other branches created, the old URL is left unused and the new URL replaces the old one for containing the work.Optimally, by my reading, it seems like this should do the trick:$ git svn clone --username=mysvnusername --authors-file=authors.txt \    --follow-parent \    http://svnserver/svn/src/branches/x/y/apps/module module(where branches/x/y/ depicts the newest branch). But I got an error, which looks something like this:W: Ignoring error from SVN, path probably does not exist: (160013): Filesystem has no item: '/svn/src/!svn/bc/100/branches/x/y/apps/module' path not foundW: Do not be alarmed at the above message git-svn is just searching aggressively for old history.(Update: Adding option --no-minimize-url to the above does not remove the error message.)The directory module get created and populated, but the Subversion history past the newest svn copy commit is not imported (the git repository created ends up having just two commits when I expected hundreds).The question is, how to export the full Subversion history in the presence of this situation?Possible CauseSearching for the error message, I found this: git-svn anonymous checkout fails with -swhich linked to this Subversion issue: http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3242What I understand by my reading, something in Subversion 1.5 changed about how the client accesses the repository. With newer Subversion, if there is no read access to some super directory of the URL path (true for me, svn ls http://svnserver/svn fails with 403 Forbidden), then we fail with some Subversion operations.Jeff Fairley in his answer points out that spaces in the Subversion URL might also cause this error message (confirmed by user Owen). Have a look at his solution to see how he solved the case if your git svn clone is failing for the same resson.Dejay Clayton in his answer reveals that if the deepest subdirectory components in branch and tag svn urls are equally named (e.g. .../tags/release/1.0.0 and .../branches/release-candidates/1.0.0) then this error could occur."

"git-apply fails mysteriously, how do I troubleshoot/fix?I'm currently trying to to code-style checking on the PRs of a (github) repository, and I want to deliver patches to the submitters with which they can easily fix the codestyle. To this end, I'm pulling down their PR, run our uncrustify script over it to fix any style errors, and want to create a .patch file they can easily apply. However, it consistently breaks on some files.I do (git version 1.7.10.4 with core.autocrlf=input, core.filemode=false):$ git checkout pr-branch$ git log -1 (shows: commit dbb8d3f)$ git status (nothing to commit, working directory clean)$ <run the code styler script, which modifies some files>$ git diff > ../style.patch (so the patch file lands outside the repo)$ git reset --hard HEAD (to simulate the situation at the submitter's end)$ git log -1 (shows: commit dbb8d3f)$ git status (nothing to commit, working directory clean, so we are where we started)$ git apply ../style.patcherror: patch failed: somefile.cpp:195error: somefile.cpp: patch does not apply (same output using the --check option)This only applies to some files, not all of them. I don't know how to troubleshoot this, i.e. how to get git to tell me exactly where it goes wrong - it only tells me a hunk# when I dig, but that's still pretty huge.What I've tried so far (without success): apply --reverse, apply --whitespace=nowarndiff HEAD instead of diff alonemake a dummy commit (committing works without problem!), use format-patch, delete the dummy commit, apply patch with git-am with or without -3, or apply with  git-applyHave the patch file in the local dir instead of one up (grasping at straws, here)Check the man-pages of git-diff, -apply, -format-patch, -am for anything usefulpatch with the linux patch command....I don't know what could be wrong with the diff. Whitespace things should only warn, right? In any case, I won't want to ignore them, since it's a style fix which obviously involves whitespace.How can I fix/diagnose this or even find out where it bails exactly? Would it help if I posted the diff of one of the culprit files? What baffles me also is that the committ works without problem, but the patch created from the commit does not??After wrestling with this for several hours I'm at the end of my knowledge..."

"TFS/GIT in VS Cannot switch to master because there are uncommitted changesI've setup a GIT repository for a VS 2013 solution on visualstudio.com. The repository worked great while I was becoming accustomed to using TFS (in GIT mode).Then I decided to familiarize myself with Branches, so I created a branch off of the master. I've made quite a few changes in this branch. I've committed the changes over time and have performed a Sync to push my local commits to the visualstudio.com repository. This all works.The problem I am having is that I somehow lost the ability of switching back to the master branch. I cannot merge my newly created branch into the master. Every time I try to do anything that involves the master I get the following error in VS:Cannot switch to master because there are uncommitted changes. Commit or undo your changes before you switch branches. See the Output window for details.The Output window never contains any 'details'...What ""uncommitted changes"" does this message refer to?

"Git internals: Modifying `git-merge-one-file` to not use working treeIs it possible to modify the default git-merge-one-file program to do everything in the index without touching the working tree, leaving it completely unmodified?UPDATE AND DETAILSSo I understand now that a file-level merge (where the merge is acting on lines in the file rather than whole files) can't occur without using a worktree. (Unlike a merge acting on whole files.) So I'm gonna have to use a worktree.Another detail: I'm okay with the solution working only in the cases where the merge can be done automatically without manual resolution. It's okay if it just shows an error message if the merge is not automatic. (And of course, leave everything clean.)Another detail: I'm not using git-merge-one-file directly, I'm using it inside this script: https://gist.github.com/cool-RR/6575042I tried to follow @torek 's advice and use a temporary work tree (as you can see in the script), because that seems like the best direction so far.

"Stuck repo using stash after crlf normalization?I have my local repo in a state that forbid me to either commit, stash, checkout to another branch or even discard changes. So I'm just stuck.I will try to describe what steps brought me to this situation, as far as I remember.Please, take a seat.A not so long time ago, in another computer far, far away... an other dev normalized crlf in the project according to: https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endingsIn the while (you know, speed of light...) I made some changes locally, commited, and pulled.When I pulled Git said:error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:    wp-config.phpwp-config.php was earlier removed from the index using git update-index --assume-unchanged wp-config.php since its a template config file adapted to each local environment.The base ""template"" can change. Nothing surprising. Here what I planned:reindex wp-config.phpstash my own config changespull origin masterstash apply my config backThings went wrong at step 3. git pull origin master still raised the error above, as if the stash was ineffective.git status said wp-config.php had changes not staged for commit. That surprised me a bit after a stash.Since I stashed my changes I ran git checkout -- wp-config.php... but without any effect! File was still not staged for commit.Since I was becoming mad, I created a new branch my-config, added and commited wp-config.php into it, then switched back to master, deleted wp-config.php (using git rm), and merged origin/master... with success!So now that master was up to date and clean, I planned to restore my own config without the help of Git (editing the file manually).Since I wanted to know what happened, I switched to my-config branch, and tried here a very simple manipulation:git stashgit stash applyAnd guess what? stash apply failed saying:error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:    wordpress/license.txt    wordpress/readme.html    ...    (all the files that where modified by the crlf conversion)And now I'm stuck on my branch (and plan to saw it, Francophones will understand ;)) since:git stash apply, commit and checkout master gives the error abovegit stash produces a stash entry but doesn't change the unstaged statesand git checkout -- <file> neither removes the unstaged stateThe only thing I can do now is to delete all these files (using the OS rm) to be able to go back to the master branch.True story.I would love to understand what happened on the master branch, then on my-config branch, and what brought me in such situations (I suspect using stash on crlf converted file).Important notes:I run on linuxgit core.autocrlf is on inputmy .gitattributes is the same as the one in ""dealing-with-line-endings"" articleI'm relatively new to Git (2nd day living with it)When I did stash on my-config branch it outputed:warning: CRLF will be replaced by LF in wordpress/license.txt.The file will have its original line endings in your working directory....

"Merge error after converting Git submodule to subtreeI have a project where I was originally using submodules for some dependent code. It turns out that submodules are not really appropriate for this project (and they are hard to use in practice), so I am converting each submodule to a subtree (using the new git-subtree feature).In my working repository, I have successfully removed each submodule and have added the old submodule repo as a subtree. No problem with this.When I go to another clone and attempt to pull from the first one, I get the following error from the merge step:error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:        sub/.gitignore        sub/Makefile        sub/README        sub/src/main.c        ... and so on for all files in sub/AbortingIt seems that this is because the files in sub/ never really existed in the main repository in the first place, and when Git applies the patch to update .gitmodules it doesn't remove the directory with the submodule files. When processing the next commit, where Git tries to create the new files in sub/ that are now part of the main repository, all those files conflict with the still-existing files in sub/. The workaround I have found is to use rm -rf sub before git pull, which avoids this problem.My question is, is there any command line switch I can use with git merge that says ""Overwrite any files that happen to exist in the working directory""? Even better would be a feature where git merge would look at the contents of the existing file, and if the contents are identical to the file it was going to create anyway, suppress the error message and continue.UPDATE: I have created Git repositories that demonstrate this problem, to show exactly what I'm talking about. To reproduce:$ git clone https://github.com/ghewgill/q14224966.git$ cd q14224966$ git submodule init$ git submodule update$ git merge origin/branchThis should result in the error messageerror: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:    sub/Makefile    sub/README    sub/src/main.cPlease move or remove them before you can merge.Aborting"

I realized that I was confused by a number of things going on, some of which were exacerbated by IntelliJ IDEA (a tool I generally love, BTW). First, the 'fatal: pathspec' message from git rm is both unhelpful and misleading (in this vanilla user's opinion). Second, I had the file in .gitignore, but had removed it before asking my question. However, it was also included in IDEA's Ignored Files feature independently of git, and showed as such in the project viewer (instead of untracked, as git status showed). Finally, I had IDEA running while I was experimenting, and it looks like it was recreating the file immediately after my rm. So, my takeaway is that if I'm getting confusing Git behavior, make sure to quit IDEA and work soley in the command line (and gitk) while debugging. And that SO users are awesome. Thanks again!"

"How do I fix 'bus error' when trying to do git-commit or git-statusI have a git repository on an OS X server that used to work fine.

That allowed me to do git status again!Running git commit -a directly after that, however, gave the following error:fatal: Unable to create '/path/to/repo/.git/index.lock': File exists.If no other git process is currently running, this probably means agit process crashed in this repository earlier.

"Error building trees error prevents committing to branchI have a local git repository on my Mac that is managed by Xcode. I recently created a new branch and have made a lot of changes since then. I was about to perform my first commit to this new branch and was presented with an error dialog:The working copy ""app name"" failed to commit files.error: invalid object 100644888688965... for 'Supporting Files/animage.png'error: Error building treesI searched the Interwebs for a solution and found this question which appears to be the same issue. I tried both answers to this question and neither solved the problem for me. I have done everything I can think of to solve the problem but have not been successful. I tried looking for the problematic file as the answer suggested but there are no files in /repo/.git/objects/88. I also looked in backups (I have hourly Time Machine backups) but there never were files in that folder.I tried git reset --hard and this removed uncommitted changes, but after doing so I cannot commit a simple change. The exact same error message is presented.I tried to trash the image referenced in the error message, but then the next time I attempt to commit the same error is displayed referencing a different image. After trashing all images it started listing code files.I tried creating a new branch and committing to that branch, but the same error is presented.I switched to my other partition where I previously worked on this project (the files sync over Dropbox which may have been the cause of the problem) and attempted a commit only to experience the same error message.I finally decided to restore the entire project to an earlier point in time, I went back two months ago before I even made any branches, yet still a simple commit refuses to work. This makes me believe an external factor is involved, something outside of the project folder. I know it worked back then so this has me very confused.

That way, I can merge the differences as though each of the three versions of the script were the tips of different branches.I'm not even sure whether this is necessarily a sane or reasonable way to go about solving this problem... Any advice on how to do things this way, or advice on a better way to handle this situation would be much appreciated."

"Browse orphaned commits in GitMy git repository has somehow gone wonky - I loaded up msysgit this morning and instead of the branch name being shown after the current directory, it says ""((ref: re...))"", 'git status' reports everything as a new file, 'git log' and 'git reflog' tell me ""fatal: bad default revision 'HEAD'"", and so on.Doing 'git reflog --all' or 'gitk --all' shows me the rest of the repository is intact, but it looks like the branch I was working on has just disappeared, which explains why HEAD doesn't seem to exist/point to anything.I know git keeps hold of all sorts of globs of information, and I'm assuming my commits have just been orphaned somehow, so is there some command that will show me those commits so I can reset HEAD to them?EDIT: Oh dear. I discovered 'git fsck', and 'git fsck --full' reports ""fatal: object 03ca4... is corrupted"". What the devil can I do about that?EDIT: Oh dear oh dear. I checked out another branch, then tried to re-create the original branch with the same name using 'git checkout -b lostbranchname', and git says ""error: unable to resolve reference refs/heads/lostbranchname: No error, fatal: Failed to lock ref for update: No error"". 'No error' must be a particularly nasty error. So it looks like it's still hanging around, but unable to be used and unable to be killed.EDIT: Super duper oh dear.

"Trouble merging upstream changes back into my branchI'm running into conflicts while trying to merge upstream changes back into my branch and I'm not sure how to resolve them.I created my own fork. I cloned it. I made changes to the branch on my fork, committed, and pushed.

It tells me to fix it myself and re-merge.

No problem with this.When I go to another clone and attempt to pull from the first one, I get the following error from the merge step:error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:        sub/.gitignore        sub/Makefile        sub/README        sub/src/main.c        ... and so on for all files in sub/AbortingIt seems that this is because the files in sub/ never really existed in the main repository in the first place, and when Git applies the patch to update .gitmodules it doesn't remove the directory with the submodule files. When processing the next commit, where Git tries to create the new files in sub/ that are now part of the main repository, all those files conflict with the still-existing files in sub/. The workaround I have found is to use rm -rf sub before git pull, which avoids this problem.My question is, is there any command line switch I can use with git merge that says ""Overwrite any files that happen to exist in the working directory""? Even better would be a feature where git merge would look at the contents of the existing file, and if the contents are identical to the file it was going to create anyway, suppress the error message and continue.UPDATE: I have created Git repositories that demonstrate this problem, to show exactly what I'm talking about. To reproduce:$ git clone https://github.com/ghewgill/q14224966.git$ cd q14224966$ git submodule init$ git submodule update$ git merge origin/branchThis should result in the error messageerror: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:    sub/Makefile    sub/README    sub/src/main.cPlease move or remove them before you can merge.Aborting"

"Adding a new directory to a GitHub repository branch and merging back to the trunkI'm having trouble merging a branch back to the trunk after adding a new directory.I created a new branch BUG_BRANCH, made a few code changes, added a directory, and added several files to that directory.  I used ""git add ."" to add my changes for committing to my local branch. Then ""git commit -am 'message here'"". I then pushed my branch up to GitHub ""git push origin BUG_BRANCH"", checked out the main development branch again ""git checkout dev"", and grabbed any changes that had happened since I'd created my branch ""git pull origin dev"".My problem occurred when I tried to merge the changes from my BUG_BRANCH to dev ""git merge BUG_BRANCH"". For each file within the newly created directory, I got ""error: cannot stat 'path': Permission denied"". When I log into GitHub, I see my changes hanging out in the remote copy of my branch. But I can't merge them into dev, and I can't even seem to get back to BUG_BRANCH locally; I get the same error message.Looking around on StackOverflow, it seems that I could have added the directory using the -A option of add if I could get back to my branch. But I can't. Any ideas?"

"How to interactively (visually) resolve conflicts in SourceTree / gitI'm using (Windows) SourceTree for my git project.

"‰ÛÏNo commit specified and merge.defaultToUpstream not set‰ÛùAs a new git user, who is an expert with SVN and CVS, I am struggling to get the most basic of git functions to work.I'm using a shared repo at assembla.comI created a local clone, and added a file:$ git clone repository-url$ echo ""hello"" > ha.txt$ git add -A$ git commit -a -m ""haha""$ git pushNOTE: at this point I got ""No refs in common and none specified; doing nothing"" error.After some hours googling, I found the solution was to type this$ git push origin masterThen I went onto another computer, modified the file, and commit-ed it (surprisingly, I didn't need to do the git push origin magic).Then I back to the main computer, modified it again, so I could see how merge works.$ git fetch$ git mergeNow I get the error:fatal: No commit specified and merge.defaultToUpstream not set.Looking at the man page for ""git merge"", you have to specify something like this:$ git merge [< commit >..]The problem is, I cant find out what < commit > means, and what it should be.  E.g. should it be a file, a repo, a message, a version?I have not created a branch - I'm just working on the ""head"" or master as I think git calls itUnfortunately, google is not much help on this one.  The man pages seem to expect you to know what a < refspec >, < commit > and origin are.Any help on this noob problem appreciated."

"Error in git book or I misunderstood?Here you can read:Tracking Branches Checking out a local branch from a remote branch  automatically creates what is called a tracking branch. Tracking  branches are local branches that have a direct relationship to a  remote branch. If you‰Ûªre on a tracking branch and type git push, Git  automatically knows which server and branch to push to. Also, running  git pull while on one of these branches fetches all the remote  references and then automatically merges in the corresponding remote  branch.Instead of merges in the corresponding remote branch shouldn't day merge in the corresponding local branch?"

"Git rebase --preserve-merges failsI have a (large) commit tree that contains several merge commits that I want to rebase to another commit. Doing a normal rebase causes git to ask me to resolve merge conflicts. I didn't want to review each merge, because this would be a lot of work. After finding out about the --preserve-merges option, which is neatly explained here, I thought I found the perfect tool for this task. However, I cannot seem to get it to work properly. I have created a toy example that demonstrates the problem.Starting from an empty folder, we first create a branch with a merge and another branch on which we will rebase.A---B--\      \ ---C---D \  ---EWhere master refers to B, branch refers to D and goodbye-branch refers to E.git initecho Hello > Hello.txtgit add Hello.txtgit commit -m ""Create Hello.txt (commit A)""git tag startecho World! >> Hello.txtgit commit -am ""Change to Hello World (commit B)""git checkout startgit checkout -b branchecho Dave >> Hello.txtgit commit -am ""Change to Hello Dave (commit C)""git merge masterecho Hello World, Dave! > Hello.txtgit add Hello.txtgit commit -m ""Merge branch master into branch (commit D)""git checkout startgit checkout -b goodbye-branchecho Goodbye > Goodbye.txtgit add Goodbye.txtgit commit -m ""Add Goodbye.txt (commit E)""Up to this point, everything went ok. There was a merge conflict, but we resolved it. Now we try to rebase branch onto E to end up with the following commit tree:A---E----B'     \    \      C'---D'git checkout branchgit rebase -p goodbye-branchThis end with the following error:Auto-merging Hello.txtCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in Hello.txtAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.Error redoing merge f567809e2cc91244cc7fdac210e1771dc75e4d86The file contains the following content:Hello<<<<<<< HEADDave=======World!>>>>>>> 0437403c97f33f229e41ec9584ce891a50052e48What am I doing wrong?

Not a good idea, I tell you.Now the interactive rebase seems to be ""stuck"". Git shows the current branch as (|REBASE-m).

"Removing/undoing a merge on SourcetreeI made quite few changes in my project (I was working on a remote branch and not the master), I committed them and created a pull request on BitBucket and merged the branch to master.

"How do I manage conflicts with git submodules?I have a git superproject that references several submodules and I am trying to lock down a workflow for the rest of the my project members to work within.For this question, lets say my superproject is called supery and the submodule is called subby. (Then is a simplification of what I'm trying to do...I'm not actually using the branches for versions, but I thought it would be easiest to lay out as a question.)My master branch of supery has the tag v1.0 of the git project subby referenced as a submodule. The branch of supery called one.one and changed the reference of the submodule to point to the tag v1.1 of subby.I can work  within each of these branches without a hitch, but if I try to update the one.one branch with changes from the master branch I receive some conflicts and I don't how to resolve them.Basically after running a git pull . master while in the subby branch, it looks like it creates additional submodules.Before the pull/merge, I get the desired response from git submodule from the one.one branch:$ git checkout master$ git submoduleqw3rty...321e subby (v1.0)$ git checkout one.one$ git submoduleasdfgh...456d subby (v1.1)But after the pull, it adds additional submodules when I run git submodule:$ git pull . masterAuto-merged schemaCONFLICT (submodule): Merge conflict in subby - needs qu3rty...321eAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the results.$ git submoduleqw3rty...321e subby (v1.0)asdfgh...456d subby (v1.1)zxcvbn...7890 subby (v1.1~1)How do I delete/ignore the unwanted submodule references and commit my conflicts and changes? Or is there a parameter I can use with my original git pull that will ignore my submodules?"

"What's the difference between git reset --hard and git reset --mergeIn my experiments I haven't been able to find any functional difference betweengit reset --hardandgit reset --mergeThe usage instructions don't give any hint either--hard                reset HEAD, index and working tree--merge               reset HEAD, index and working treeI regularly use the --hard option so understand how that works.

"What should I do when git revert aborts with an error message?OK, so I'm getting an error sometimes when I try to revert a commit (with Git).

"How to make git merge handle uncommitted changes to my working tree?A co-worker and I are both working on the master branch at the moment.  I have some code in my working tree that I don't want to commit (debugging statements and the like).  Now if he commits changes to some of those same files, I can't merge them:$ git merge origin/masterUpdating 1b8c5c6..eb44c23error: Entry 'blah.java' not uptodate. Cannot merge.Coming from a subversion background, I'm used to having my working tree automatically merged when I pull changes from the repository and if there are conflicts, I resolve them manually.The quickest way I have found to do this in git is:$ git stash$ git merge origin/master$ git stash popEssentially, removing my uncommitted changes, doing the merge and then re-applying the changes.  How can I tell merge to automatically merge my working tree with the changes I'm trying to pull in?"
"Which commit hash to undo a pushed merge using git-revert?I merged the beta branch into the master branch.  I pushed to origin.  I now want master to be as it was prior to the merger both locally and remotely.A good answer for undoing a merge that was already pushed suggests git revert -m 1 commit_hashIf this is indeed the way to go, how can I determine commit_hash?  I unsuccessfully tried the hash returned by merge-base:$ git merge-base --all master beta1f4b949b7ef97abf913ae672e3acd0907abfac1b$ git revert -m 1 1f4b949b7ef97abf913ae672e3acd0907abfac1berror: Mainline was specified but commit 1f4b949b7ef97abf913ae672e3acd0907abfac1b is not a merge.fatal: revert failedI've examined both git-log and gitk renditions of the branches, but they're very long, and I am uncertain enough of my interpretation to feel I should seek assistance before making a perhaps bigger mess.  Beta was derived from v2 which was derived from master.  There have been some mergers from master into v2 and beta along the way as I've kept the new branches up-to-date with master.  The merger in the direction from beta into master was a mistake I wish to correct.Once I do determine the merge point, if I find any commits made on master after the merger that really should be on the beta branch, what's the best way to move them over?"
"Merging after directory got turned into submoduleI find that working with git submodules, I often encounter problems merging between commits which do contain a given submodules and those which represent the same code as a normal directory.

Which makes this whole problem particularly annoying.# Try to merge the feature branchgit checkout mastergit merge branchThis fails again, with an error message I don't fully understand:CONFLICT (file/directory): There is a directory with name a in branch.

But if I forget to do so, and then try doing that after the merge, I receive this error message:Submodule 'a' (‰Û_/a) registered for path 'a'Skipping unmerged submodule aHow do I recover from this situation? Something other than git merge --abort, since I'd like to use it for things like git rebase as well, and since in some scenarios (don't know how to reproduce) I couldn't even abort the merge cleanly, and had to do a hard reset instead.How can I avoid it in the first place? Is there some magic setting which makes git do the right thing with submodules vs. directories during merges, so that I don't have to manually post-process a merge which only modifies files unrelated to the submodules?"

"Resolve conflicts using remote changes when pulling from Git remoteI'm trying to pull code from my GitHub repo onto my server, but the pull keeps failing because of merge conflicts.

"Cannot Merge due to conflict with UserInterfaceState.xcuserstateI created a branch and made a bunch of changes. I committed the changes and then archived the changes. Then I switched to the master branch and tried to do a merge. It said I had uncommitted changes. So I did a commit on the master branch to see what it was talking about. It said that there is a file called UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate that was modified. So I committed the change (not sure what the change was). Then I tried to merge again. It then opens up a merge window and indicates that there is a conflict with UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate. So I went back to the branch and found that that same file is now needing to be committed. This did not show up before. So I committed it and went back to the master branch. Again I tried to merge but cant because of uncommitted changes.

"Best (and safest) way to merge a git branch into masterA new branch from master is created, we call it test.There are several developers who either commit to master or create other branches and later merge into master.Let's say work on test is taking several days and you want to continuously keep test updated with commits inside master.I would do git pull origin master from test. Question 1: Is this the right approach?  Other developers could have easily worked on same files as I have worked btw.My work on test is done and I am ready to merge it back to master. Here are the two ways I can think of:A: git checkout testgit pull origin mastergit push origin testgit checkout mastergit pull origin test B: git checkout testgit pull origin mastergit checkout mastergit merge testI am not using --rebase because from my understanding, rebase will get the changes from master and stack mine on top of that hence it could overwrite changes other people made.Question 2: Which one of these two methods is right?  What is the difference there?The goal in all of this is to keep my test branch updated with the things happening in master and later I could merge them back into master hoping to keep the timeline as linear as possible."
"Git rebase continually fails and requires manual merge interventionI am having an issue with rebasing from master on to a 'deploy' branch within one of my repositories.My repo is setup as follows:master - of course, the main branchdeploy - a branch created where files like Capfile, deploy.rb etc are created and configured - these changes will NEVER be merged back into MasterGenerally my workflow is:Do development on the master branch... test, smile, commit.Checkout the deploy branchExecute git rebase master on the deploy branch - this used to work without a problemPush to remote and then execute cap deployRelaxThe problem I am now having is that when I execute git rebase master on the deploy branch it is coming up with a 3-way merge/manual merge required error (I don't think the error message is really generic enough to post). Git tells me to perform a merge then use git rebase --continue to finish - which never works.What I have found 'does' work is running git rebase master --interactive, cleaning up the pick list (there is 5 or so repeated 'commits' but with different reference numbers (same message) in this list, so I'll choose one of them) and then manually do the merge. Once I have done this for each commit then I can continue the rebase and its all happy...Until next time I need to perform a rebase.So does anyone know what might be happy? The project isn't really 'secret' so if need be I can post messages, logs, branch graphs etc.Thanks"

Therefore I would like to revert the merge operation on the master branch, but without overwriting history.Note that I would like to be able to merge opengl branch into master eventually (after I will fix all the bugs). Therefore simply checking out older version of master and commiting it will not work - newly created commit will cancel my changes from opengl when I will try to merge it.Thank you."

"Unresolvable Git error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkoutI am using Git alone for my local software project in Visual Studio 2010. Recently I created a new branch to do a larger refactoring of one of the dialogue windows. I did the following modifications:Rename Form1 to Form1a (including all depending files)Add new Form1I checked this change into the branch, say form-refactoring. Interestingly, Git didn't notice that I renamed the file Form1.cs into Form1a.cs and created a brand new, totally different Form1.cs, but instead it noticed a new Form1a.cs file and found a whole lot of differences between the previous and new Form1.cs files. This will of course lead to totally garbaged diffs, but I don't care in this case as long as all files are handled correctly in the end.Then I switched back to master to do some other small changes. Nothing conflicting. Until now, everything worked fine.Today, I wanted to switch back to my branch form-refactoring to continue that work. But all I get is the following message:git.exe checkout    form-refactoringAbortingerror: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:Form1.Designer.csPlease move or remove them before you can switch branches.What is that supposed to be?

What would happen if I delete it, is it gone for good then? I don't trust Git to bring back the correct file if I delete something now. I did not play with any file at all outside of my mentioned Git operations, so why should I play around with any file to continue using Git operations now?

"Why does git-rebase give me merge conflicts when all I'm doing is squashing commits?We have a Git repository with over 400 commits, the first couple dozen of which were a lot of trial-and-error. We want to clean up these commits by squashing many down into a single commit. Naturally, git-rebase seems the way to go. My problem is that it ends up with merge conflicts, and these conflicts are not easy to resolve. I don't understand why there should be any conflicts at all, since I'm just squashing commits (not deleting or rearranging). Very likely, this demonstrates that I'm not completely understanding how git-rebase does its squashes.Here's a modified version of the scripts I'm using:repo_squash.sh (this is the script that is actually run):rm -rf repo_squashgit clone repo repo_squashcd repo_squash/GIT_EDITOR=../repo_squash_helper.sh git rebase --strategy theirs -i bd6a09a484b8230d0810e6689cf08a24f26f287arepo_squash_helper.sh (this script is used only by repo_squash.sh):if grep -q ""pick "" $1then#  cp $1 ../repo_squash_history.txt#  emacs -nw $1  sed -f ../repo_squash_list.txt < $1 > $1.tmp  mv $1.tmp $1else  if grep -q ""initial import"" $1  then    cp ../repo_squash_new_message1.txt $1  elif grep -q ""fixing bad import"" $1  then    cp ../repo_squash_new_message2.txt $1  else    emacs -nw $1  fifirepo_squash_list.txt: (this file is used only by repo_squash_helper.sh)# Initial imports/pick \(251a190\)/squash \1/g# Leaving ""Needed subdir"" for now# Fixing bad imports/pick \(46c41d1\)/squash \1/gs/pick \(5d7agf2\)/squash \1/gs/pick \(3da63ed\)/squash \1/gI'll leave the ""new message"" contents to your imagination. Initially, I did this without the ""--strategy theirs"" option (i.e., using the default strategy, which if I understand the documentation correctly is recursive, but I'm not sure which recursive strategy is used), and it also didn't work. Also, I should point out that, using the commented out code in repo_squash_helper.sh, I saved off the original file that the sed script works on and ran the sed script against it to make sure it was doing what I wanted it to do (it was). Again, I don't even know why there would be a conflict, so it wouldn't seem to matter so much which strategy is used. Any advice or insight would be helpful, but mostly I just want to get this squashing working.Updated with extra information from discussion with Jefromi:Before working on our massive ""real"" repository, I used similar scripts on a test repository. It was a very simple repository and the test worked cleanly.The message I get when it fails is:Finished one cherry-pick.# Not currently on any branch.nothing to commit (working directory clean)Could not apply 66c45e2... Needed subdirThis is the first pick after the first squash commit. Running git status yields a clean working directory. If I then do a git rebase --continue, I get a very similar message after a few more commits. If I then do it again, I get another very similar message after a couple dozen commits. If I do it yet again, this time it goes through about a hundred commits, and yields this message:Automatic cherry-pick failed.  After resolving the conflicts,mark the corrected paths with 'git add <paths>', andrun 'git rebase --continue'Could not apply f1de3bc... IncrementalIf I then run git status, I get:# Not currently on any branch.# Changes to be committed:#   (use ""git reset HEAD <file>..."" to unstage)## modified:   repo/file_A.cpp# modified:   repo/file_B.cpp## Unmerged paths:#   (use ""git reset HEAD <file>..."" to unstage)#   (use ""git add/rm <file>..."" as appropriate to mark resolution)## both modified:      repo/file_X.cpp## Changed but not updated:#   (use ""git add/rm <file>..."" to update what will be committed)#   (use ""git checkout -- <file>..."" to discard changes in working directory)## deleted:    repo/file_Z.impThe ""both modified"" bit sounds weird to me, since this was just the result of a pick. It's also worth noting that if I look at the ""conflict"", it boils down to a single line with one version beginning it with a [tab] character, and the other one with four spaces. This sounded like it might be an issue with how I've set up my config file, but there's nothing of the sort in it. (I did note that core.ignorecase is set to true, but evidently git-clone did that automatically. I'm not completely surprised by that considering that the original source was on a Windows machine.)If I manually fix file_X.cpp, it then fails shortly afterward with another conflict, this time between a file (CMakeLists.txt) that one version thinks should exist and one version thinks shouldn't. If I fix this conflict by saying I do want this file (which I do), a few commits later I get another conflict (in this same file) where now there's some rather non-trivial changes. It's still only about 25% of the way through the conflicts.I should also point out, since this might be very important, that this project started out in an svn repository. That initial history very likely was imported from that svn repository.Update #2:On a lark (influenced by Jefromi's comments), I decided to do the change my repo_squash.sh to be:rm -rf repo_squashgit clone repo repo_squashcd repo_squash/git rebase --strategy theirs -i bd6a09a484b8230d0810e6689cf08a24f26f287aAnd then, I just accepted the original entries, as is. I.e., the ""rebase"" shouldn't have changed a thing. It ended up with the same results describe previously.Update #3:Alternatively, if I omit the strategy and replace the last command with:git rebase -i bd6a09a484b8230d0810e6689cf08a24f26f287aI no longer get the ""nothing to commit"" rebase problems, but I'm still left with the other conflicts.Update with toy repository that recreates problem:test_squash.sh (this is the file you actually run):#========================================================# Initialize directories#========================================================rm -rf test_squash/ test_squash_clone/mkdir -p test_squashmkdir -p test_squash_clone#========================================================#========================================================# Create repository with history#========================================================cd test_squash/git initecho ""README"">READMEgit add READMEgit commit -m""Initial commit: can't easily access for rebasing""echo ""Line 1"">test_file.txtgit add test_file.txtgit commit -m""Created single line file""echo ""Line 2"">>test_file.txt git add test_file.txt git commit -m""Meant for it to be two lines""git checkout -b devecho Meaningful code>new_file.txtgit add new_file.txt git commit -m""Meaningful commit""git checkout masterecho Conflicting meaningful code>new_file.txtgit add new_file.txt git commit -m""Conflicting meaningful commit""# This will conflictgit merge dev# Fixes conflictecho Merged meaningful code>new_file.txtgit add new_file.txtgit commit -m""Merged dev with master""cd ..#========================================================# Save off a clone of the repository prior to squashing#========================================================git clone test_squash test_squash_clone#========================================================#========================================================# Do the squash#========================================================cd test_squashGIT_EDITOR=../test_squash_helper.sh git rebase -i HEAD@{7}#========================================================#========================================================# Show the results#========================================================git loggit gcgit reflog#========================================================test_squash_helper.sh (used by test_sqash.sh):# If the file has the phrase ""pick "" in it, assume it's the log fileif grep -q ""pick "" $1then  sed -e ""s/pick \(.*\) \(Meant for it to be two lines\)/squash \1 \2/g"" < $1 > $1.tmp  mv $1.tmp $1# Else, assume it's the commit message fileelse# Use our pre-canned message  echo ""Created two line file"" > $1fiP.S.: Yes, I know some of you cringe when you see me using emacs as a fall-back editor.P.P.S.: We do know we'll have to blow away all of our clones of the existing repository after the rebase.

I then made changes to another copy and committed them - when I tried to pull the changes I unsurprisingly got an error saying my ""local changes to the file would be overwritten by merge, aborting"". So I removed the offending file using git rm, then used git add -u and committed the deletion. I then tried to pull in the latest copy and got the following. What's the best way to deal with this? grateful for any pointersCONFLICT (delete/modify): wp-content/plugins/wp-flash-countdown/xml_option_.xml deleted in HEAD and modified in ba878ab1efe3a039961a446c490d5c93a2bc22e1.

"xCode 4.5 git merge fails to commit or give errorsI have two branches that I am trying to merge in xCode 4.5.  After I resolve the two conflicting files and press the ""Merge"" button, the merge screen disappears, no errors come up, and it looks like it is successful.

There is no indication how to proceed within xCode. Here is what I get if I do git status from the command line.

"Problems with automatic merging of Visual Studio Projects (unresolved conflicts) in Git/GitHubA friend and I just started using git in conjunction with GitHub to help us manage our C# w/XNA project we are working on in Visual Studio 2010. Everything works correctly when only one person is making changes to the file, and his work pushes and merges correctly with the central repository. However, when we have two different people working on the code and making changes at the same time, the last person to push always has to deal with a manual merge when trying to pull the first person's changes, as the automatic one fails.     This happens even if the changes we made were unrelated (I.E. One person adds a completely random, unused class and the other adds a second random, unused variable a different, unused class). We have probably spent a combined 3 hours or so fooling with this issue to no avail. I know that there are programs one can use to help facilitate manual merges, but I wanted to make sure that it wasn't some setting causing this issue. Thanks!EDIT: We are now using a .gitignore file in our repository(this one here), and it seems as though we've made some progress. Now when the second person pulls to merge before pushing his changes, it does seem to make the change on his local copy (meaning his project file registers the change I made previously), but he is still unable to merge fully as he gets the following error when he performs a git pull:warning: Cannot merge binary files: collision/collision.suo (HEAD vs db023c2075...)Auto-Merging collision/collision.suoCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in collision/collision.suoAutomatic merge failed.

When I try to do git merge A on B, I get:error: Untracked working tree file 'path/file.php' would be overwritten by merge.

"Is it possible for git-merge to ignore line-ending differences?Is it possible for git merge to ignore line-ending differences?Maybe I'm asking the wrong question ... but:I tried uisng config.crlf input but things got a bit messy and out of control, specially when I applied it after the fact.For one thing, applying this config after the fact doesn't seem to affect files that were committed to the repository before applying this option. Another thing is that suddenly all commits now result in lots of annoying warning messages about CRLF being converted to LF.To be honest, I don't really care what line-ending is used, I personally prefer the Unix style \n, but whatever. All I care about, is for git merge to be a bit smarter and ignore the differences in line-endings.Sometimes I have two identical files, but git would mark them as being in conflict (and the conflict is the whole file) simply because they use a different line ending character.Update:I found out that git diff accepts a --ignore-space-at-eol option, would it be possible to let git merge use this option as well?"

"git: how do I merge between branches while keeping some changesets exclusive to one branch?There's a special place in hell for people who hardcode absolute paths and database credentials into multiple random places in web applications.

I also tag this as local.I merrily leap into perilous hacking penitence, and after a perplexing hundred patches, I want to merge my features changes into the master branch, but I do not want the one local commit to be merged.Onwards, I'll be merging back and forth between master and features, and I'd like local to stay put in features, and never ever show up in master.Ideally, I'd like all this to happen magically, with as little funny parameters and whatnot as possible.Is there a simple obvious way to do it that I'm missing?I can think of a couple, but they all require me to remember that I don't want that commit.

"Simple tool to 'accept theirs' or 'accept mine' on a whole file using gitI don't want a visual merge tool, and I also don't want to have to vi the conflicted file and manually choose the between HEAD (mine) and the imported change (theirs).  Most of the time I either want all of their changes or all of mine.  Commonly this is because my change made it upsteam and is coming back to me through a pull, but may be slightly modified in various places.Is there a command line tool which will get rid of the conflict markers and choose all one way or another based on my choice?  Or a set of git commands which I can alias myself to do each one.# accept minealias am=""some_sequence;of;commands""alias at=""some_other_sequence;of;commands""Doing this is rather annoying.For 'accept mine' I have tried: randy@sabotage ~/linus $ git merge test-branchAuto-merging MakefileCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in MakefileAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.randy@sabotage ~/linus $ git checkout Makefile error: path 'Makefile' is unmergedandy@sabotage ~/linus $ git reset --hard HEAD Makefile fatal: Cannot do hard reset with paths.How am I supposed to get rid of these change markers?I can do: git reset HEAD Makefile; rm Makefile; git checkout MakefileBut this seems rather round about, there must be a better way.  And at this point, I'm not sure if git even thinks the merge happened, so I don't think this necessarily even works.Going the other way, doing 'accept theirs' is equally messy.The only way I can figure it out is do:git show test-branch:Makefile > Makefile; git add Makefile;This also gives me a messed up commit message, which has Conflicts: Makefile in it twice.Can someone please point out how to do the above two actions in a simpler way?  Thanks"

"Git Checkout warning: unable to unlink files, permission deniedI am aware that there are similar issues about git relating to the 'unable to unlink' warning, but I have not been able to use them.The main difference is that this happened when I have not been dealing with submodules in any way (I have never dealt with them before).  I created a branch called 'upgrade', deleted my old framework files, and copied in the new ones.  I used git add -A, then committed everything.  When I tried to checkout the trunk branch, it responded with the following errors:warning: unable to unlink requirements/views/sk/index.php: Permission deniedwarning: unable to unlink requirements/views/sv/index.php: Permission deniedwarning: unable to unlink requirements/views/zh/index.php: Permission deniedwarning: unable to unlink requirements/views/zh_cn/index.php: Permission deniedwarning: unable to unlink requirements/views/zh_tw/index.php: Permission denied...etc.  There are hundreds of them.At first I thought this was simply a permissions problem, and so I added group write permissions to the entire requirements directory recursively, but there was no change.Edit: As suggested in an answer below, I attempted to do the same thing but with everything else closed.  I had no more luck than before.This issue is particularly debilitating as I cannot move to trunk to get back to normal development.Thanks a lot,Daniel Moniz"

"Xcode Project file git merge conflictIn Xcode, what's the best way to avoid Git conflict in the project file? (I am in manual git, not using Xcode interface for git)I've cloned mapbox-ios-sdk from Github, hacked it, and now the remote master has changed. When I tried to pull the remote changes into my local, after merging there would be merge conflict in the project file. (Specifically, I mean the project.pbxproj in the .xcodeproj)I do not really think project file should be put into the ignore, since if there are any new files the project file, the .pbxproj file seems to be changed. (Or am I just plain wrong and this file should be put to ignore? But obviously it wasn't on ignored in the mapbox-ios-sdk to begin with. People need the project file after all.)

"Merging from one Git branch to another after getting the error ‰ÛÏmultiple merge bases found‰ÛùI have a Git repository with three branches, master, 2.x and 3.x.  2.x and 3.x originated from master.  Weekly releases are made to production from the master branch.  2.x and 3.x contain work that will be released a little far off in the future.  Immediately after making a production release from the master branch we merge from the master branch to both 2.x and 3.x so that the latest production code gets into 2.x and 3.x as well.  In addition, frequently, we merge from 2.x to 3.x as well as the features being developed on 3.x eventually need to be integrated with the features being developed on 2.x.Last week, after we merged from master to 2.x and 3.x, we discovered that no one had made any changes to 3.x between the just concluded merge from master and the previous merge from master.  Now, when we try to merge from 2.x to 3.x, the merge operation fails with the error ""multiple merge bases found"".Is it possible to merge from 2.x to 3.x, now that we are in this situation?

"Undo git stash pop that results in merge conflictI began making changes to my codebase, not realizing I was on an old topic branch. To transfer them, I wanted to stash them and then apply them to a new branch off of master.

"git-subtree pull complicationsWe have been trying to get git-subtree working on a project (with git version 1.7.9.4) and have run into a bit of a complication.

None of the files have been modified since they were imported. I've tried three things to try and merge in the changes.First:git subtree pull --squash -P foo git@example.com:foo.git masterWhich throws the exception: Can't squash-merge: 'foo' was never added.Second:git subtree pull -P foo git@example.com:foo.git masterThis works (sort of), but has the issue of pulling in all of the commits and has conflicts with the files that have been modified. Finally, I tried this:git pull --squash -s subtree git@example.com:foo.git  masterThis gives me the desired result, with the output Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested and all of the files showing up as modified (with the correct content).Ideally I'd like to continue using first git-subtree version and get an output close to the last version.

"Composer & composer.lock in GIT and merge conflictsHere's our situation :We have 3 different Laravel projects and all 3 projects rely on our Core project.This Core project is a separate Laravel package hosted on our private repo and is used as a dependency for other projects.Before, whenever something would change in the Core project we woud just run a composer update ourvendor/ourcorepackage on our servers for each project to pull in the core changes. However as of lately composer seems to suffer from serious memory issues when we try to run the update on our Digital Ocean staging environment with 512 MB Ram. See : https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/1898The solution I always come across is people saying that you should always run composer install on your production servers. I can relate to that in terms of security because it can be dangerous if you update to a new version of some 3rd party package that can possibly break your code. But in our case we only update our own core package so we know what we're doing but this memory issue forces us to use the composer install method because it is less memory demanding.So basically this is our current workflow :When something changes in our core package we need to run a composerupdate ourvendor/ourpackage on each project LOCALLY This generates acomposer.lock fileWe commit the composer.lock file in our repoOn the servers for each project we run a git pull and run a composerinstall. This will only update our core package and runs much fasterand has no memory issues vs composer updateHowever this solution raises 2 issues :Since we're working with multiple devs on the same project we sometimes end up having merge conflicts for the composer.lock file when pulling in the changes locally.Running a git pull on the server gives an error : Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge: composer.lockPlease, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.So what am I supposed to do here? Before the pull on the server remove the composer.lock file?How should we handle the merge conflicts for the composer.lock file?It's a shame that composer update suffers from memory issues because that method seems much more logical. Just update the package you want and no hassle with the composer.lock file..Please advice how a correct workflow with GIT and composer should be in our case and how to solve the conflicts above ?Many thanks for your input"

If i try again (without restarting the IDE first), nothing seems to happen at all when i click Commit/Commit and Push.Sadly, Google searches have so far not been very helpful to me, so if any of you could help me out, i would really appreciate it.I have heard, however, that git might sometimes clash with Windows on changing the capitalization of file names. I do remember renaming my Utilities package to utilities and Adapters package to adapters. Could this be causing my problem and if so, how can i fix this?Thanks in advance."

(cd .\your_respository_name.git). I then removed the index.lock file in that directory (rm -r index.lock).3)Then from within that same directory I ran git reset HEAD.4)Then I manually committed each file using the ""git add [file_name]"" comand. (You can check that they were added successfully if when you run git status, the files are green.5)Next run git commit if your files are added correctly.6)Finally go back to github for windows and sync everything up and it should hopefully work and resolve the problem."

Eclipse seems to have picked it up, okay, but when I try to commit, I get a popup saying""Committing changes has encountered a problem' -- an internal error occured.When I click details, it say ""An internal error occurredException caught during execution of commit command""...I don't even know where to start on this one. I googled the error and didn't get anything useful. Anyone know how to fix this, or at least how to start debugging?"

"Xcode 4.0.2 Git Commit Error: fatal: '‰Û_' is outside repository (Possible Bug)This is an issue in XCode in which the built-in source control feature is unable to load the repository for projects located within a directory named with ALL-CAPS, such as ~/Documents/CODE.  Running XCode 4.0.2 on a 2008 black macbook.  If anyone has insight, please share.This was the issue.I create a new project, save it to the directory ~/Documents/CODE/...here-or-a-subdirectory-therein, making sure to check the ""create local git repository"" checkbox.  I make a small edit to the AppDelegate or any other file, and Source Control commits will not work from within XCode.  From the command-line, I see that .git was created in the project directory, and that the 'first commit' occurred.  I can perform git commits from the command-line. Possibly related issue: In Organizer->repositories, all my repositories have the yellow stoplight icon (even those I've gotten to work).  This was the Error:When I try to commit from the project window (File-->SourceControl-->Commit, type a comment, and press commit) I get the following error:The Working copy of ""MyProjectName"" failed to commit files.  fatal: '/Users/myUserName/Documents/CODE/MyProjectName/MyProjectName/MyProjectNameAppDelegate.m' is outside repository.Over in the Organizer, I select MyProjectName (with the drop-down arrow and icon of the repository safe).  The location is displayed as /Users/myUserName/Documents/CODE/MyProjectName/But in the area where the commit comments are normally displayed, I see the message:Unable to load revisions.The likely cause was that XCode was internally identifying the Project directory as ~/Documents/Code, not ~/Documents/CODE.One way to resolve the issue was to rename ~/Documents/CODE to ~/Documents/Code, then in Organizer (select the Repositories Tab) I deleted the repository listing for MyProjectName. NOTE - Only removes XCode's reference to the repository, the actual repository remains intact.  Now Close XCode and Reopen it.  Open the project MyProjectName.  XCode will recreate a reference to the Project with the correct Capitalization.  Note that the renaming of the directory seems to force XCode to recognize the new directory name when the repository is recreated.Another way to resolve the issue is: within XCode's Organizer window (select the Repositories Tab), delete the reference to the repository.  Then, still in Organizer, select the ""Projects"" tab at top.  To the left of the project's window is a list of all the projects...select MyProjectName.  Now in the center frame is a field named ""Derived Data"" with a path to your project.  Click the little -> arrow to the right of the PATH to open up the Project's Internal Settings Directory in Finder.  Open the file called ""info.plist"" and edit the key ""WorkspacePath"" such that it's value EXACTLY MATCHES the location of your project (correct the capitalization of the directory if necessary).  Save, and return to Organizer.  Close XCode.  Reopen XCode and the repository reference will be recreated.  You can go directly into Organizer now, select the ""Repositories"" tab, then select MyProjectName's repository.  You'll see the commit messages there (even if you haven't committed yet, you'll still see the auto-generated 'first-commit' that occurred internally when your project was created)."

Here's my .vimrc (identical across all machines): https://github.com/tswett/setup/blob/c84c8908a04a1d925d90da3da4f2fc83bf56172b/.vimrc"
"Git commit fails with Vim and GVimWhen I try to do a git commit -a, I get a nice vim instance. I type in my message, do :wq, vim closes down and the terminal has the message, Aborting commit due to empty commit message.Pursuant to this question I made sure my core.editor says ""gvim"" (so does the user.editor, fwiw), but I still get that error message.Does anyone have another idea?Edit 1: I am able to commit by specifying a file.

"Cannot resolve Git/Xcode 7 repository issue - commit fails, error building treesI recently posting another thread for this issue, but was not able to resolve it from the responses posted. In short, upgraded to XCode 7 and somehow a new branch was created...had previously only worked on the master branch. During my first commit on XC7, I got the error that the commit failed due to failing to build trees (full error provided in above link). I've tried a few things, including what was suggested in the response to my previous thread, but it did not work. I've also tried going into XC and clicking on Source Control->App Name->master->Switch to Branch and then selecting the master branch thinking this would get me back to master branch. When doing that I got an error: Failed to write reference 'refs/heads/master': a reference with that name already exists. (-4).I am completely stuck and really need to get past this. Can someone please help provide an alternate solution? Can I just download the current code from git and start a new XCode project? I'm using cocoa pods so I launch the project from the projectname.xcworkspace file...would it cause issues if I tried starting a new porject? I've made a few code changes that I was trying to check in when I discovered the issue but I've copied them to my desktop and could replace them once I get the source control issue resolved. Thanks!"
"How do I fix 'bus error' when trying to do git-commit or git-statusI have a git repository on an OS X server that used to work fine.

That allowed me to do git status again!Running git commit -a directly after that, however, gave the following error:fatal: Unable to create '/path/to/repo/.git/index.lock': File exists.If no other git process is currently running, this probably means agit process crashed in this repository earlier.

"Trouble merging upstream changes back into my branchI'm running into conflicts while trying to merge upstream changes back into my branch and I'm not sure how to resolve them.I created my own fork. I cloned it. I made changes to the branch on my fork, committed, and pushed. But then the main fork updated, and I tried to update my own fork by merging upstream in like so:$ cd repo-name$ git remote add upstream git://github.com/username/repo-name.git$ git fetch upstream$ git merge upstream/masterThe merge says that there's some problem with a file and auto-merging doesn't work. It tells me to fix it myself and re-merge. So I actually went to the (upstream) repository on GitHub of the main fork and copied all the code of the new file into the file on my fork, and tried to merge again. Then, git gives me this error:fatal: 'merge' is not possible because you have unmerged files.  Please, fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm ' as  appropriate to mark resolution and make a commit, or use 'git commit -a'.Is there some argument I'm leaving out? Am I doing something stupid? What does it mean by ""unmerged files?"" Isn't the whole point of merging to merge files? Do I have to commit my changes before I merge?"

I put those in correctly and every time I do this, it says the same error.Does anyone have any idea what the cause of this problem is and how I can fix it?The contents of .git/config are:[core]        repositoryformatversion = 0        filemode = true        bare = false        logallrefupdates = true[remote ""origin""]        url = http://www.github.com/######/Random-Python-Tests        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*[branch ""master""]        remote = origin        merge = refs/heads/master[user]        name = #####        email = ############"

"How do you restore a corrupted object in a git repository (for newbies)?I tried to open my repository today and it came up with no commit history. Everything I tried (git status, git log, git checkout...) threw an error about a corrupt object.I researched this problem online and found the article by Linus Torvalds, but got lost at the point where he found the broken link ID: none of my file IDs, tree or blob, match the culprit ID thrown by the error message.I then returned to the article on recovering ""git objects damaged by hard disk failure"" and (after moving the culprit object out of the way) worked my way through until $ cat packed-refsat which point my computer said: cat: packed-refs: No such file or directoryI skipped that step and did the$ git fsck --fulland got the appropriate output, but then I was supposed to copy the culprit (or what I was referring to as the culprit, the sha1 ID thrown by the error) from a backup repository back into the main repository, then copy the missing objects from the backup repository into the main repository, as far as I can tell; and I don't want to do anything too drastic or I might force something I can't unforce later.So my question(s) is (are), was I supposed to have made a backup (ooh, newbie alert), or was that what happened when I unpacked the .pack file? And is the ""culprit"" I'm copying back actually a clean file, i.e. not corrupted?(I think it only fair to tell you that I was initially confused by a simple dash in Torvalds' file between the ""git"" and ""fsck.""

"Make git automatically remove trailing whitespace before committingI'm using git with my team and would like to remove whitespace changes from my diffs, logs, merges, etc. I'm assuming that the easiest way to do this would be for git to automatically remove trailing whitespace (and other whitespace errors) from all commits as they are applied.I have tried to add the following to by ~/.gitconfig file but it doesn't do anything when I commit. Maybe it's designed for something different. What's the solution?[core]    whitespace = trailing-space,space-before-tab[apply]    whitespace = fixI'm using ruby in case anyone has any ruby specific ideas. Automatic code formatting before committing would be the next step, but that's a hard problem and not really causing a big problem."

"Git Svn dcommit error - restart the commitLast week, I made a number of changes to my local branch before leaving town for the weekend.

Either the requested version resource is out of date (needs to be updated), or the requested version resource is newer than the transaction root (restart the commit).I'm not sure exactly why I'm getting this, but before attempting to dcommit, I did a git svn rebase.  That ""overwrote"" my commits. To recover from that, I did a git reset --hard HEAD@{1}. Now my working copy seems to be where I expect it to be, but I have no idea how to get past the merge conflict; there's not actually any conflict to resolve that I can find.Any thoughts would be appreciated.EDIT: Just wanted to specify that I am working locally.

All of my work was done on the local trunk:$ git branch  maint-1.0.x  master  * trunk$ git branch -r  svn/maintenance/my-project-1.0.0  svn/trunkSimilarly, git log currently shows 10 commits on my local trunk since the last commit with a Svn ID.Hopefully that answers a few questions.Thanks again."

Is there a better way to push without getting this error message?"

I realized that I was confused by a number of things going on, some of which were exacerbated by IntelliJ IDEA (a tool I generally love, BTW). First, the 'fatal: pathspec' message from git rm is both unhelpful and misleading (in this vanilla user's opinion). Second, I had the file in .gitignore, but had removed it before asking my question. However, it was also included in IDEA's Ignored Files feature independently of git, and showed as such in the project viewer (instead of untracked, as git status showed). Finally, I had IDEA running while I was experimenting, and it looks like it was recreating the file immediately after my rm. So, my takeaway is that if I'm getting confusing Git behavior, make sure to quit IDEA and work soley in the command line (and gitk) while debugging. And that SO users are awesome. Thanks again!"

I got an error message.error: pathspec 'origin/fix/cleanup` did not match any file(s) known  to git.I tried checkout -b, but got another error.$ git checkout -b fix/cleanup origin/fix/cleanupfatal: Cannot update paths and switch to branch 'fix/cleanup' at the same time.Did you intend to checkout 'origin/fix/cleanup' which can not be resolved as commit?I also tried to execute the oneliner. for remote in `git branch -r`; do git branch --track $remote; doneBut it gave me the new branches origin/HEAD and origin/master in my local, not for the other 3 branches. What is going on my repo?I tried git fetch --all and git pull --all. They gave me nothing changed."

"Git alias gives pathspec errorI am trying to diagnose a problem with an alias that lets a user checkout the most recent commit of a file in order to clobber their most recent changes.

"trouble with adding/removing a git submoduleI'm trying to add a git submodule to my project, specifically ShareKit. My project is a git repo, and when I try to typegit submodule add git://github.com/ShareKit/ShareKit.git Submodules/ShareKitinto Terminal I got an error saying that the submodule already existed. I guess I added it a while ago to this project, and ended up not using it and improperly deleting it from the project directory (just deleting the submodule folder, most likely). So I try and dogit rm --cached Submodules/ShareKitaccording to How do I remove a Git submodule?, and now when I try and add the submodule again with the first bit of code I get this:A git directory for 'Submodules/ShareKit' is found locally with remote(s):origin  git://github.com/ShareKit/ShareKit.gitIf you want to reuse this local git directory instead of cloning again fromgit://github.com/ShareKit/ShareKit.gituse the '--force' option. If the local git directory is not the correct repoor you are unsure what this means choose another name with the '--name' option.and I'm not really sure what to do. I'm fairly new to git, and I need to get this in my project - is there any way to just wipe everything git related off of the project and start from scratch? I'd just do it with a new project but it's already pretty much complete aside from this and it would be hugely time-consuming to start from scratch and copy everything over. I have ShareKit working in a test app, installed properly, is there any reason I can't just copy all of the ShareKit files from that folder into the one I need them in?Edit: I have triedgit submodule deinit Submodules/ShareKitwhich gives me this error:error: pathspec 'Submodules/ShareKit' did not match any file(s) known to git.Did you forget to 'git add'?It seems like it's stuck in some sort of weird state where it's both insisting that the submodule does and doesn't exist simultaneously. I'm doing this with Terminal to add the submodule to an Xcode project, just to clarify."

"How to use Git properly with XCode?I have been an iphone developer for a while, and I have recently been including git in my workflow.  I have used git settings found on http://shanesbrain.net/2008/7/9/using-xcode-with-git for my workflow so far.Those settings tell git to exclude *.pbxproj from merges?  Is there a real reason for doing this?  For example, when I add a file to the project and push to origin, my fellow developers will not have that file added to their xcode project when they pull.  Then if one of them builds a release this file may not be included.  Shouldn't I just let git handle the merges for the project file?  Could someone please explain why or why not this file should be in merges and how to properly handle the situation when files are added to the project.  Thanks."
"Xcode Project file git merge conflictIn Xcode, what's the best way to avoid Git conflict in the project file? (I am in manual git, not using Xcode interface for git)I've cloned mapbox-ios-sdk from Github, hacked it, and now the remote master has changed. When I tried to pull the remote changes into my local, after merging there would be merge conflict in the project file. (Specifically, I mean the project.pbxproj in the .xcodeproj)I do not really think project file should be put into the ignore, since if there are any new files the project file, the .pbxproj file seems to be changed. (Or am I just plain wrong and this file should be put to ignore? But obviously it wasn't on ignored in the mapbox-ios-sdk to begin with. People need the project file after all.)

"Incorporating Bootstrap into a git repo, using subtree mergingI'm working on a project where we'd like to edit the LESS files that came with Twitter Bootstrap. The standard advice is to leave those files untouched, to make it easier to upgrade Bootstrap. But that advice isn't working for us; our code is becoming fragile and hard to maintain.It seems like it should be possible to solve this with git subtree merging: We could edit Bootstrap's LESS files to have clear, maintainable code, then use git's merge tools to bring in new versions of Bootstrap.We've come up with a plan for using subtree merging. But before we put the plan into action, I'd like to get some feedback: Are there significant drawbacks that we've overlooked? Is there a better/simpler approach?Approaches with significant drawbacksIn the simplest approach to subtree merging, all the commits from the subtree (i.e., Bootstrap) are merged into your project's master branch. The drawback is that Bootstrap has so many commits, our commits get lost in the noise. We'd like to keep their commits off our master branch. In theory, we could use git rebase -i to squash all the Bootstrap commits into one commit, that we then merge into master. But rebase -i does not work well with merges. @Sigi helpfully suggested that we use squash merges to go from bootstrap-upstream to master. Grabbing the initial version of Bootstrap (v3.1.0) worked OK. But when we merged in the next version (v3.1.1), we over 100 merge conflicts. Every Bootstrap change between 3.1.0 and 3.1.1 was flagged as a conflict. (Our exact steps are in this gist.)The planOur plan is to use a branch, merge-from-bootstrap, for pulling Bootstrap commits into our repository. When merging changes in to merge-from-bootstrap (either our changes on master, or Bootstrap's changes), always record the merge. When merging out from merge-from-bootstrap to master, use git merge --squash so that the merge is not recorded. Our hope is that:master stays managable, because the Bootstrap commits never become part of that branch.Git has as much information as possible when merging in a new version of Bootstrap, since the merge-from-bootstrap branch has the full history of our changes and the Bootstrap team's changes.Proof of conceptIn the following steps, we grab Bootstrap v3.1.0, make some changes, and then upgrade to v3.1.1. The POC seems to work well (as did my tests with our real repo), but I'd like to know if we're setting ourselves up for trouble down the line.Start with a new repo, where the only file is README.md (i.e., the new repo that GitHub gives you).# Add bootstrap as a remotegit remote add bootstrap https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git# Only fetch the master branch; don't fetch tagsgit config remote.bootstrap.fetch +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/bootstrap/mastergit config remote.bootstrap.tagopt --no-tagsgit fetch bootstrap# Start with Bootstrap v3.1.0git checkout -b merge-from-bootstrap# SHA is the commit tagged v3.1.0 from the bootstrap repogit merge -s ours --no-commit 1409cde7e800ca83fd761f87e5ad8f0d259e38d1git read-tree -u --prefix=bootstrap/ 1409cde7e800ca83fd761f87e5ad8f0d259e38d1git commit -am ""Bootstrap v3.1.0""# Merge Bootstrap 3.1.0 to mastergit checkout mastergit merge --squash merge-from-bootstrapgit commit -am ""Merge bootstrap v3.1.0 to master""# Make some changes on master, so that we have something to# be mergedsed -e 's/= space/= force-merge-conflict/g' -i '' bootstrap/.editorconfiggit commit -am ""Force a merge conflict""sed -e 's/""Helvetica Neue""/""Comic Sans""/g' -i '' bootstrap/less/variables.less git commit -am ""Comic Sans""# Get ready to upgrade to the new version of Bootstrapgit checkout merge-from-bootstrapgit merge -s recursive -Xtheirs master# Merge in Bootstrap v3.1.1 from bootstrap/master to# merge-to-bootstrap.
